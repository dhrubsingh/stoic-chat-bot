sms has not then reason convinced me and indeed no other things have i from the beginning so approved and chosen as the things which are rational and now i read about these things hear about them write about them i have so far discovered no reason stronger than this living according to nature in what then am i deficient have the contrary opinions not been eradicated from me have the notions opinions themselves not been exercised nor used to be applied to action but as armor are laid aside and rusted and cannot fit me and yet neither in the exercises of the palaestra nor in writing or reading am i satisfied with learning but i turn up and down the syllogisms which are proposed and i make others and sophistical syllogisms also but the necessary theorems by proceeding from which a man can become free from grief fear passions affects hindrance and a free man these i do not exercise myself in nor do i practice in these the proper practice study then i care about what others will say of me whether i shall appear to
 them worth notice whether i shall appear happy  wretched man will you not see what you are saying about yourself what do you appear to yourself to be in your opinions in your desires in your aversions from things ἐν τῷ ἐκκλίνειν in your movements purposes ἐν ὁρμῇ in your preparation for anything in your designs plans and in other acts suitable to a man but do you trouble yourself about this whether others pity youyes but i am pitied not as i ought to beare you then pained at this and is he who is pained an object of pityyeshow then are you pitied not as you ought to be for by the very act that you feel suffer about being pitied you make yourself deserving of pity what then says antisthenes have you not heard it is a royal thing o cyrus to do right well and to be ill spoken of my head is sound and all think that i have the headache what do i care for that i am free from fever and people sympathize with me as if i had a fever and say poor man for so long a time you have not ceased to have fever i also say with
 a sorrowful countenance in truth it is now a long time that i have been ill what will happen then as god may please and at the same time i secretly laugh at those who are pitying me what then hinders the same being done in this case also i am poor but i have a right opinion about poverty why then do i care if they pity me for my poverty i am not in power not a magistrate but others are and i have the opinion which i ought to have about having and not having power let them look to it who pity me but i am neither hungry nor thirsty nor do i suffer cold but because they are hungry or thirsty they think that i too am what then shall i do for them shall i go about and proclaim and say be not mistaken men i am very well i do not trouble myself about poverty nor want of power nor in a word about anything else than right opinions these i have free from restraint i care for nothing at allwhat foolish talk is this how do i possess right opinions when i am not content with being what i am but am uneasy about what i am 
supposed to be  but you say others will get more and be preferred to mewhat then is more reasonable than for those who have labored about anything to have more in that thing in which they have labored they have labored for power you have labored about opinions and they have labored for wealth you for the proper use of appearances see if they have more than you in this about which you have labored and which they neglect if they assent better than you with respect to the natural rules measures of things if they are less disappointed than you in their desires if they fall less into things which they would avoid than you do if in their intentions if in the things which they propose to themselves if in their purposes if in their motions towards an object they take a better aim if they better observe a proper behavior as men as sons as parents and so on as to the other names by which we express the relations of life but if they exercise power and you do not will you not choose to tell yourself the truth that you do
 nothing for the sake of this power and they do all but it is most unreasonable that he who looks after anything should obtain less than he who does not look after it  not so but since i care about right opinions it is more reasonable for me to have poweryes in the matter about which you do care in opinions but in a matter in which they have cared more than you give way to them the case is just the same as if because you have right opinions you thought that in using the bow you should hit the mark better than an archer and in working in metal you should succeed better than a smith give up then your earnestness about opinions and employ yourself about the things which you wish to acquire and then lament if you do not succeed for you deserve to lament but now you say that you are occupied with other things that you are looking after other things but the many say this truly that one act has no community with another he who has risen in the morning seeks whom of the house of caesar he shall salute to whom he shal
l say something agreeable to whom he shall send a present how he shall please the dancing man how by bad behavior to one he may please another when he prays he prays about these things when he sacrifices he sacrifices for these things the saying of pythagoraslet sleep not come upon thy languid eyeshe transfers to these things where have i failed in the matters pertaining to flattery what have i done anything like a free man anything like a noble minded man and if he finds anything of the kind he blames and accuses himself why did you say this was it not in your power to lie even the philosophers say that nothing hinders us from telling a lie but do you if indeed you have cared about nothing else except the proper use of appearances as soon as you have risen in the morning reflect what do i want in order to be free from passion affects and free from perturbation what am i am i a poor body a piece of property a thing of which something is said i am none of these but what am i i am a rational animal what then is
 required of me reflect on your acts where have i omitted the things which conduce to happiness εὔροιαν what have i done which is either unfriendly or unsocial what have i not done as to these things which i ought to have done  so great then being the difference in desires actions wishes would you still have the same share with others in those things about which you have not labored and they have labored then are you surprised if they pity you and are you vexed but they are not vexed if you pity them why because they are convinced that they have that which is good and you are not convinced for this reason you are not satisfied with your own but you desire that which they have but they are satisfied with their own and do not desire what you have since if you were really convinced that with respect to what is good it is you who are the possessor of it and that they have missed it you would not even have thought of what they say about you  vii on freedom from fear what makes the tyrant formidable the guards you 
say and their swords and the men of the bedchamber and those who exclude them who would enter why then if you bring a boy child to the tyrant when he is with his guards is he not afraid or is it because the child does not understand these things if then any man does understand what guards are and that they have swords and comes to the tyrant for this very purpose because he wishes to die on account of some circumstance and seeks to die easily by the hand of another is he afraid of the guards no for he wishes for the thing which makes the guards formidable if then any man neither wishing to die nor to live by all means but only as it may be permitted approaches the tyrant what hinders him from approaching the tyrant without fear nothing if then a man has the same opinion about his property as the man whom i have instanced has about his body and also about his children and his wife and in a word is so affected by some madness or despair that he cares not whether he possesses them or not but like children who ar
e playing with shells care quarrel about the play but do not trouble themselves about the shells so he too has set no value on the materials things but values the pleasure that he has with them and the occupation what tyrant is then formidable to him or what guards or what swords  then through madness is it possible for a man to be so disposed towards these things and the galilaeans through habit and is it possible that no man can learn from reason and from demonstration that god has made all the things in the universe and the universe itself completely free from hindrance and perfect and the parts of it for the use of the whole all other animals indeed are incapable of comprehending the administration of it but the rational animal man has faculties for the consideration of all these things and for understanding that it is a part and what kind of a part it is and that it is right for the parts to be subordinate to the whole and besides this being naturally noble magnanimous and free man sees that of the thing
s which surround him some are free from hindrance and in his power and the other things are subject to hindrance and in the power of others that the things which are free from hindrance are in the power of the will and those which are subject to hindrance are the things which are not in the power of the will and for this reason if he thinks that his good and his interest be in these things only which are free from hindrance and in his own power he will be free prosperous happy free from harm magnanimous pious thankful to god for all things in no matter finding fault with any of the things which have not been put in his power nor blaming any of them but if he thinks that his good and his interest are in externals and in things which are not in the power of his will he must of necessity be hindered be impeded be a slave to those who have the power over the things which he admires desires and fears and he must of necessity be impious because he thinks that he is harmed by god and he must be unjust because he alw
ays claims more than belongs to him and he must of necessity be abject and mean  what hinders a man who has clearly separated comprehended these things from living with a light heart and bearing easily the reins quietly expecting everything which can happen and enduring that which has already happened would you have me to bear poverty come and you will know what poverty is when it has found one who can act well the part of a poor man would you have me to possess power let me have power and also the trouble of it well banishment wherever i shall go there it will be well with me for here also where i am it was not because of the place that it was well with me but because of my opinions which i shall carry off with me for neither can any man deprive me of them but my opinions alone are mine and they cannot be taken from me and i am satisfied while i have them wherever i may be and whatever i am doing but now it is time to die why do you say to die make no tragedy show of the thing but speak of it as it is it is 
now time for the matter of the body to be resolved into the things out of which it was composed and what is the formidable thing here what is going to perish of the things which are in the universe what new thing or wondrous is going to happen is it for this reason that a tyrant is formidable is it for this reason that the guards appear to have swords which are large and sharp say this to others but i have considered about all these things no man has power over me i have been made free i know his commands no man can now lead me as a slave i have a proper person to assert my freedom i have proper judges i say are you not the master of my body what then is that to me are you not the master of my property what then is that to me are you not the master of my exile or of my chains well from all these things and all the poor body itself i depart at your bidding when you please make trial of your power and you will know how far it reaches  whom then can i still fear those who are over the bedchamber lest they should
 dowhat shut me out if they find that i wish to enter let them shut me out why then do you go to the doors because i think it befits me while the play sport lasts to join in it how then are you not shut out because unless someone allows me to go in i do not choose to go in but am always content with that which happens for i think that what god chooses is better than what i choose i will attach myself as a minister and follower to him i have the same movements pursuits as he has i have the same desires in a word i have the same will συνφέλω there is no shutting out for me but for those who would force their way in why then do not i force my way in because i know that nothing good is distributed within to those who enter but when i hear any man called fortunate because he is honored by caesar i say what does he happen to get a province the government of a province does he also obtain an opinion such as he ought the office of a prefect does he also obtain the power of using his office well why do i still strive 
to enter caesars chamber a man scatters dried figs and nuts the children seize them and fight with one another men do not for they think them to be a small matter but if a man should throw about shells even the children do not seize them provinces are distributed let children look to that money is distributed let children look to that praetorships consulships are distributed let children scramble for them let them be shut out beaten kiss the hands of the giver of the slaves but to me these are only dried figs and nuts what then if you fail to get them while caesar is scattering them about do not be troubled if a dried fig come into your lap take it and eat it for so far you may value even a fig but if i shall stoop down and turn another over or be turned over by another and shall flatter those who have got into caesars chamber neither is a dried fig worth the trouble nor anything else of the things which are not good which the philosophers have persuaded me not to think good  show me the swords of the guards 
see how big they are and how sharp what then do these big and sharp swords do they kill and what does a fever do nothing else and what else a falling tile nothing else would you then have me to wonder at these things and worship them and go about as the slave of all of them i hope that this will not happen but when i have once learned that everything which has come into existence must also go out of it that the universe may not stand still nor be impeded i no longer consider it any difference whether a fever shall do it or a tile or a soldier but if a man must make a comparison between these things i know that the soldier will do it with less trouble to me and quicker when then i neither fear anything which a tyrant can do to me nor desire anything which he can give why do i still look on with wonder admiration why am i still confounded why do i fear the guards why am i pleased if he speaks to me in a friendly way and receives me and why do i tell others how he spoke to me is he a socrates is he a diogenes th
at his praise should be a proof of what i am have i been eager to imitate his morals but i keep up the play and go to him and serve him so long as he does not bid me to do anything foolish or unreasonable but if he says to me go and bring leon of salamis i say to him seek another for i am no longer playing the tyrant says lead him away to prison i follow that is part of the play but your head will be taken offdoes the tyrants head always remain where it is and the heads of you who obey himbut you will be cast out unburiedif the corpse is i i shall be cast out but if i am different from the corpse speak more properly according as the fact is and do not think of frightening me these things are formidable to children and fools but if any man has once entered a philosophers school and knows not what he is he deserves to be full of fear and to flatter those whom afterwards he used to flatter and if he has not yet learned that he is not flesh nor bones nor sinews νεῦρα but he is that which makes use of these parts 
of the body and governs there and follows understands the appearances of things  yes but this talk makes us despise the lawsand what kind of talk makes men more obedient to the laws who employ such talk and the things which are in the power of a fool are not law and yet see how this talk makes us disposed as we ought to be even to these men fools since it teaches us to claim in opposition to them none of the things in which they are able to surpass us this talk teaches us as to the body to give it up as to property to give that up also as to children parents brothers to retire from these to give up all it only makes an exception of the opinions which even zeus has willed to be the select property of every man what transgression of the laws is there here what folly where you are superior and stronger there i gave way to you on the other hand where i am superior do you yield to me for i have studied cared for this and you have not it is your study to live in houses with floors formed of various stones how your 
slaves and dependents shall serve you how you shall wear fine clothing have many hunting men lute players and tragic actors do i claim any of these have you made any study of opinions and of your own rational faculty do you know of what parts it is composed how they are brought together how they are connected what powers it has and of what kind why then are you vexed if another who has made it his study has the advantage over you in these things but these things are the greatest and who hinders you from being employed about these things and looking after them and who has a better stock of books of leisure of persons to aid you only turn your mind at last to these things attend if it be only a short time to your own ruling faculty ἡγεμονικόν consider what this is that you possess and whence it came this which uses all other faculties and tries them and selects and rejects but so long as you employ yourself about externals you will possess them externals as no man else does but you will have this the ruling fac
ulty such as you choose to have it sordid and neglected  viii against those who hastily rush into the use of the philosophic dress never praise nor blame a man because of the things which are common to all or to most and do not ascribe to him any skill or want of skill and thus you will be free from rashness and from malevolence this man bathes very quickly does he then do wrong certainly not but what does he do he bathes very quickly are all things then done well by no means but the acts which proceed from right opinions are done well and those which proceed from bad opinions are done ill but do you until you know the opinion from which a man does each thing neither praise nor blame the act but the opinion is not easily discovered from the external things acts this man is a carpenter why because he uses an axe what then is this to the matter this man is a musician because he sings and what does that signify this man is a philosopher because he wears a cloak and long hair and what does a juggler wear for this
 reason if a man sees any philosopher acting indecently immediately he says see what the philosopher is doing but he ought because of the mans indecent behavior rather to say that he is not a philosopher for if this is the preconceived notion πρόληψις of a philosopher and what he professes to wear a cloak and long hair men would say well but if what he professes is this rather to keep himself free from faults why do we not rather because he does not make good his professions take from him the name of philosopher for so we do in the case of all other arts when a man sees another handling an axe badly he does not say what is the use of the carpenters art see how badly carpenters do their work but he says just the contrary this man is not a carpenter for he uses an axe badly in the same way if a man hears another singing badly he does not say see how musicians sing but rather this man is not a musician but it is in the matter of philosophy only that people do this when they see a man acting contrary to the profe
ssion of a philosopher they do not take away his title but they assume him to be a philosopher and from his acts deriving the fact that he is behaving indecently they conclude that there is no use in philosophy  what then is the reason of this because we attach value to the notion πρόληψιν of a carpenter and to that of a musician and to the notion of other artisans in like manner but not to that of a philosopher and we judge from externals only that it is a thing confused and ill defined and what other kind of art has a name from the dress and the hair and has not both theorems and a material and an end what then is the material matter of the philosopher is it a cloak no but reason what is his end is it to wear a cloak no but to possess the reason in a right state of what kind are his theorems are they those about the way in which the beard becomes great or the hair long no but rather what zeno says to know the elements of reason what kind of a thing each of them is and how they are fitted to one another and 
what things are consequent upon them will you not then see first if he does what he professes when he acts in an unbecoming manner and then blame his study pursuit but now when you yourself are acting in a sober way you say in consequence of what he seems to you to be doing wrong look at the philosopher as if it were proper to call by the name of philosopher one who does these things and further this is the conduct of a philosopher but you do not say look at the carpenter when you know that a carpenter is an adulterer or you see him to be a glutton nor do you say see the musician thus to a certain degree even you perceive understand the profession of a philosopher but you fall away from the notion and you are confused through want of care  but even the philosophers themselves as they are called pursue the thing philosophy by beginning with things which are common to them and others as soon as they have assumed a cloak and grown a beard they say i am a philosopher but no man will say i am a musician if he has 
bought a plectrum fiddlestick and a lute nor will he say i am a smith if he has put on a cap and apron but the dress is fitted to the art and they take their name from the art and not from the dress for this reason euphrates used to say well a long time i strove to be a philosopher without people knowing it and this he said was useful to me for first i knew that when i did anything well i did not do it for the sake of the spectators but for the sake of myself i ate well for the sake of myself i had my countenance well composed and my walk all for myself and for god then as i struggled alone so i alone also was in danger in no respect through me if i did anything base or unbecoming was philosophy endangered nor did i injure the many by doing anything wrong as a philosopher for this reason those who did not know my purpose used to wonder how it was that while i conversed and lived altogether with all philosophers i was not a philosopher myself and what was the harm for me to be known to be a philosopher by my a
cts and not by outward marks see how i eat how i drink how i sleep how i bear and forbear how i cooperate how i employ desire how i employ aversion turning from things how i maintain the relations to things those which are natural or those which are acquired how free from confusion how free from hindrance judge of me from this if you can but if you are so deaf and blind that you cannot conceive even hephaestus to be a good smith unless you see the cap on his head what is the harm in not being recognized by so foolish a judge  so socrates was not known to be a philosopher by most persons and they used to come to him and ask to be introduced to philosophers was he vexed then as we are and did he say and do you not think that i am a philosopher no but he would take them and introduce them being satisfied with one thing with being a philosopher and being pleased also with not being thought to be a philosopher he was not annoyed for he thought of his own occupation what is the work of an honorable and good man to 
have many pupils by no means they will look to this matter who are earnest about it but was it his business to examine carefully difficult theorems others will look after these matters also in what then was he and who was he and whom did he wish to be he was in that employed in that wherein there was hurt damage and advantage if any man can damage me he says i am doing nothing if i am waiting for another man to do me good i am nothing if i wish for anything and it does not happen i am unfortunate to such a contest he invited every man and i do not think that he would have declined the contest with anyone what do you suppose was it by proclaiming and saying i am such a man far from it but by being such a man for further this is the character of a fool and a boaster to say i am free from passions and disturbance do not be ignorant my friends that while you are uneasy and disturbed about things of no value i alone am free from all perturbation so is it not enough for you to feel no pain unless you make this proc
lamation come together all who are suffering gout pains in the head fever ye who are lame blind and observe that i am sound free from every ailmentthis is empty and disagreeable to hear unless like aesculapius you are able to show immediately by what kind of treatment they also shall be immediately free from disease and unless you show your own health as an example  for such is the cynic who is honored with the sceptre and the diadem by zeus and says that you may see o men that you seek happiness and tranquillity not where it is but where it is not behold i am sent to you by god as an example i who have neither property nor house nor wife nor children not even a bed nor coat nor household utensil and see how healthy i am try me and if you see that i am free from perturbations hear the remedies and how i have been cured treated this is both philanthropic and noble but see whose work it is the work of zeus or of him whom he may judge worthy of this service that he may never exhibit anything to the many by which
 he shall make of no effect his own testimonywhereby he gives testimony to virtue and bears evidence against external things  his beauteous face pales not nor from his cheeks he wipes a tear odyssey xi  and not this only but he neither desires nor seeks anything nor man nor place nor amusement as children seek the vintage or holidays always fortified by modesty as others are fortified by walls and doors and doorkeepers  but now these men being only moved to philosophy as those who have a bad stomach are moved to some kinds of food which they soon loathe straightway rush towards the sceptre and to the royal power they let the hair grow they assume the cloak they show the shoulder bare they quarrel with those whom they meet and if they see a man in a thick winter coat they quarrel with him man first exercise yourself in winter weather see your movements inclinations that they are not those of a man with a bad stomach or those of a longing woman first strive that it be not known what you are be a philosopher to 
yourself or philosophize to yourself a short time fruit grows thus the seed must be buried for some time hid grow slowly in order that it may come to perfection but if it produces the ear before the jointed stem it is imperfect a produce of the garden of adonis such a poor plant are you also you have blossomed too soon the cold weather will scorch you up see what the husbandmen say about seeds when there is warm weather too early they are afraid lest the seeds should be too luxuriant and then a single frost should lay hold of them and show that they are too forward do you also consider my man you have shot out too soon you have hurried towards a little fame before the proper season you think that you are something a fool among fools you will be caught by the frost and rather you have been frostbitten in the root below but your upper parts still blossom a little and for this reason you think that you are still alive and flourishing allow us to ripen in the natural way why do you bare expose us why do you force
 us we are not yet able to bear the air let the root grow then acquire the first joint then the second and then the third in this way then the fruit will naturally force itself out even if i do not choose for who that is pregnant and filled with such great principles does not also perceive his own powers and move towards the corresponding acts a bull is not ignorant of his own nature and his powers when a wild beast shows itself nor does he wait for one to urge him on nor a dog when he sees a wild animal but if i have the powers of a good man shall i wait for you to prepare me for my own proper acts at present i have them not believe me why then do you wish me to be withered up before the time as you have been withered up  ix to a person who had been changed to a character of shamelessness when you see another man in the possession of power magistracy set against this the fact that you have not the want desire of power when you see another rich see what you possess in place of riches for if you possess nothin
g in place of them you are miserable but if you have not the want of riches know that you possess more than this man possesses and what is worth much more another man possesses a handsome woman wife you have the satisfaction of not desiring a handsome wife do these things appear to you to be small and how much would these persons give these very men who are rich and in possession of power and live with handsome women to be able to despise riches and power and these very women whom they love and enjoy do you not know then what is the thirst of a man who has a fever he possesses that which is in no degree like the thirst of a man who is in health for the man who is in health ceases to be thirsty after he has drunk but the sick man being pleased for a short time has a nausea he converts the drink into bile vomits is griped and more thirsty it is such a thing to have desire of riches and to possess riches desire of power and to possess power desire of a beautiful woman and to sleep with her to this is added jealo
usy fear of being deprived of the thing which you love indecent words indecent thoughts unseemly acts  and what do i lose you will say my man you were modest and you are so no longer have you lost nothing in place of chrysippus and zeno you read aristides and evenus have you lost nothing in place of socrates and diogenes you admire him who is able to corrupt and seduce most women you wish to appear handsome and try to make yourself so though you are not you like to display splendid clothes that you may attract women and if you find any fine oil for the hair you imagine that you are happy but formerly you did not think of any such thing but only where there should be decent talk a worthy man and a generous conception therefore you slept like a man walked forth like a man wore a manly dress and used to talk in a way becoming a good man then do you say to me i have lost nothing so do men lose nothing more than coin is not modesty lost is not decent behavior lost is it that he who has lost these things has sustai
ned no loss perhaps you think that not one of these things is a loss but there was a time when you reckoned this the only loss and damage and you were anxious that no man should disturb you from these good words and actions  observe you are disturbed from these good words and actions by nobody but by yourself fight with yourself restore yourself to decency to modesty to liberty if any man ever told you this about me that a person forces me to be an adulterer to wear such a dress as yours to perfume myself with oils would you not have gone and with your own hand have killed the man who thus calumniated me now will you not help yourself and how much easier is this help there is no need to kill any man nor to put him in chains nor to treat him with contumely nor to enter the forum go to the courts of law but it is only necessary for you to speak to yourself who will be most easily persuaded with whom no man has more power of persuasion than yourself first of all condemn what you are doing and then when you have 
condemned it do not despair of yourself and be not in the condition of those men of mean spirit who when they have once given in surrender themselves completely and are carried away as if by a torrent but see what the trainers of boys do has the boy fallen rise they say wrestle again till you are made strong do you also do something of the same kind for be well assured that nothing is more tractable than the human soul you must exercise the will and the thing is done it is set right as on the other hand only fall anodding be careless and the thing is lost for from within comes ruin and from within comes help then you say what good do i gain and what greater good do you seek than this from a shameless man you will become a modest man from a disorderly you will become an orderly man from a faithless you will become a faithful man from a man of unbridled habits a sober man if you seek anything more than this go on doing what you are doing not even a god can now help you  x what things we ought to despise and wha
t things we ought to value the difficulties of all men are about external things their helplessness is about externals what shall i do how will it be how will it turn out will this happen will that all these are the words of those who are turning themselves to things which are not within the power of the will for who says how shall i not assent to that which is false how shall i not turn away from the truth if a man be of such a good disposition as to be anxious about these things i will remind him of this why are you anxious the thing is in your own power be assured do not be precipitate in assenting before you apply the natural rule on the other side if a man is anxious uneasy about desire lest it fail in its purpose and miss its end and with respect to the avoidance of things lest he should fall into that which he would avoid i will first kiss love him because he throws away the things about which others are in a flutter others desire and their fears and employs his thoughts about his own affairs and his o
wn condition then i shall say to him if you do not choose to desire that which you will fail to obtain nor to attempt to avoid that into which you will fall desire nothing which belongs to which is in the power of others nor try to avoid any of the things which are not in your power if you do not observe this rule you must of necessity fail in your desires and fall into that which you would avoid what is the difficulty here where is there room for the words how will it be and how will it turn out and will this happen or that  now is not that which will happen independent of the will yes and the nature of good and of evil is it not in the things which are within the power of the will yes is it in your power then to treat according to nature everything which happens can any person hinder you no man no longer then say to me how will it be for however it may be you will dispose of it well and the result to you will be a fortunate one what would hercules have been if he said how shall a great lion not appear to me
 or a great boar or savage men and what do you care for that if a great boar appear you will fight a greater fight if bad men appear you will relieve the earth of the bad suppose then that i lose my life in this way you will die a good man doing a noble act for since we must certainly die of necessity a man must be found doing something either following the employment of a husbandman or digging or trading or serving in a consulship or suffering from indigestion or from diarrhea what then do you wish to be doing when you are found by death i for my part would wish to be found doing something which belongs to a man beneficent suitable to the general interest noble but if i cannot be found doing things so great i would be found doing at least that which i cannot be hindered from doing that which is permitted me to do correcting myself cultivating the faculty which makes use of appearances laboring at freedom from the affects laboring at tranquillity of mind rendering to the relations of life their due if i succe
ed so far also i would be found touching on advancing to the third topic or head safety in the forming judgments about things if death surprises me when i am busy about these things it is enough for me if i can stretch out my hands to god and say the means which i have received from thee for seeing thy administration of the world and following it i have not neglected i have not dishonored thee by my acts see how i have used my perceptions see how i have used my preconceptions have i ever blamed thee have i been discontented with anything that happens or wished it to be otherwise have i wished to transgress the established relations of things that thou hast given me life i thank thee for what thou hast given so long as i have used the things which are thine i am content take them back and place them wherever thou mayest choose for thine were all things thou gavest them to meis it not enough to depart in this state of mind and what life is better and more becoming than that of a man who is in this state of mind
 and what end is more happy  but that this may be done that such a declaration may be made a man must receive bear no small things nor are the things small which he must lose go without you cannot both wish to be a consul and to have these things the power of making such a dying speech and to be eager to have lands and these things also and to be solicitous about slaves and about yourself but if you wish for anything which belongs to another that which is your own is lost this is the nature of the thing nothing is given or had for nothing and where is the wonder if you wish to be a consul you must keep awake run about kiss hands waste yourself with exhaustion at other mens doors say and do many things unworthy of a free man send gifts to many daily presents to some and what is the thing that is got twelve bundles of rods the consular fasces to sit three or four times on the tribunal to exhibit the games in the circus and to give suppers in small baskets or if you do not agree about this let someone show me wh
at there is besides these things in order then to secure freedom from passions ἀπαφείας tranquillity to sleep well when you do sleep to be really awake when you are awake to fear nothing to be anxious about nothing will you spend nothing and give no labor but if anything belonging to you be lost while you are thus busied or be wasted badly or another obtains what you ought to have obtained will you immediately be vexed at what has happened will you not take into the account on the other side what you receive and for what how much for how much do you expect to have for nothing things so great and how can you one work thing has no community with another you cannot have both external things after bestowing care on them and your own ruling faculty but if you would have those give up this if you do not you will have neither this nor that while you are drawn in different ways to both the oil will be spilled the household vessels will perish that may be but i shall be free from passions tranquilthere will be a fire 
when i am not present and the books will be destroyed but i shall treat appearances according to naturewell but i shall have nothing to eat if i am so unlucky death is a harbour and death is the harbour for all this is the place of refuge and for this reason not one of the things in life is difficult as soon as you choose you are out of the house and are smoked no more why then are you anxious why do you lose your sleep why do you not straightway after considering wherein your good is and your evil say both of them are in my power neither can any man deprive me of the good nor involve me in the bad against my will why do i not throw myself down and snore for all that i have is safe as to the things which belong to others he will look to them who gets them as they may be given by him who has the power who am i who wish to have them in this way or in that is a power of selecting them given to me has any person made me the dispenser of them those things are enough for me over which i have power i ought to manage
 them as well as i can and all the rest as the master of them god may choose  when a man has these things before his eyes does he keep awake and turn hither and thither what would he have or what does he regret patroclus or antilochus or menelaus for when did he suppose that any of his friends was immortal and when had he not before his eyes that on the morrow or the day after he or his friend must die yes he says but i thought that he would survive me and bring up my sonyou were a fool for that reason and you were thinking of what was uncertain why then do you not blame yourself and sit crying like girlsbut he used to set my food before mebecause he was alive you fool but now he cannot but automedon will set it before you and if automedon also dies you will find another but if the pot in which your meat was cooked should be broken must you die of hunger because you have not the pot which you are accustomed to do you not send and buy a new pot he says  no greater ill than this could fall on me iliad xix  why 
is this your ill do you then instead of removing it blame your mother thetis for not foretelling it to you that you might continue grieving from that time what do you think do you not suppose that homer wrote this that we may learn that those of noblest birth the strongest and the richest the most handsome when they have not the opinions which they ought to have are not prevented from being most wretched and unfortunate  xi about purity cleanliness some persons raise a question whether the social feeling is contained in the nature of man and yet i think that these same persons would have no doubt that love of purity is certainly contained in it and that if man is distinguished from other animals by anything he is distinguished by this when then we see any other animal cleaning itself we are accustomed to speak of the act with surprise and to add that the animal is acting like a man and on the other hand if a man blames an animal for being dirty straightway as if we were making an excuse for it we say that of 
course the animal is not a human creature so we suppose that there is something superior in man and that we first receive it from the gods for since the gods by their nature are pure and free from corruption so far as men approach them by reason so far do they cling to purity and to a love habit of purity but since it is impossible that mans nature οὐσία can be altogether pure being mixed composed of such materials reason is applied as far as it is possible and reason endeavors to make human nature love purity  the first then and highest purity is that which is in the soul and we say the same of impurity now you could not discover the impurity of the soul as you could discover that of the body but as to the soul what else could you find in it than that which makes it filthy in respect to the acts which are her own now the acts of the soul are movement towards an object or movement from it desire aversion preparation design purpose assent what then is it which in these acts makes the soul filthy and impure not
hing else than her own bad judgments κρίματα consequently the impurity of the soul is the souls bad opinions and the purification of the soul is the planting in it of proper opinions and the soul is pure which has proper opinions for the soul alone in her own acts is free from perturbation and pollution  now we ought to work at something like this in the body also as far as we can it was impossible for the defluxions of the nose not to run when man has such a mixture in his body for this reason nature has made hands and the nostrils themselves as channels for carrying off the humors if then a man sucks up the defluxions i say that he is not doing the act of a man it was impossible for a mans feet not to be made muddy and not be soiled at all when he passes through dirty places for this reason nature god has made water and hands it was impossible that some impurity should not remain in the teeth from eating for this reason she says wash the teeth why in order that you may be a man and not a wild beast or a hog
 it was impossible that from the sweat and the pressing of the clothes there should not remain some impurity about the body which requires to be cleaned away for this reason water oil hands towels scrapers strigils nitre sometimes all other kinds of means are necessary for cleaning the body you do not act so but the smith will take off the rust from the iron instruments and he will have tools prepared for this purpose and you yourself wash the platter when you are going to eat if you are not completely impure and dirty but will you not wash the body nor make it clean why he replies i will tell you again in the first place that you may do the acts of a man then that you may not be disagreeable to those with whom you associate you do something of this kind even in this matter and you do not perceive it you think that you deserve to stink let it be so deserve to stink do you think that also those who sit by you those who recline at table with you that those who kiss you deserve the same either go into a desert w
here you deserve to go or live by yourself and smell yourself for it is just that you alone should enjoy your own impurity but when you are in a city to behave so inconsiderately and foolishly to what character do you think that it belongs if nature had entrusted to you a horse would you have overlooked and neglected him and now think that you have been entrusted with your own body as with a horse wash it wipe it take care that no man turns away from it that no one gets out of the way for it but who does not get out of the way of a dirty man of a stinking man of a man whose skin is foul more than he does out of the way of a man who is daubed with muck that smell is from without it is put upon him but the other smell is from want of care from within and in a manner from a body in putrefaction  but socrates washed himself seldomyes but his body was clean and fair and it was so agreeable and sweet that the most beautiful and the most noble loved him and desired to sit by him rather than by the side of those who 
had the handsomest forms it was in his power neither to use the bath nor to wash himself if he chose and yet the rare use of water had an effect if you do not choose to wash with warm water wash with cold but aristophanes says  those who are pale unshod tis those i mean the clouds line  for aristophanes says of socrates that he also walked the air and stole clothes from the palaestra but all who have written about socrates bear exactly the contrary evidence in his favor they say that he was pleasant not only to hear but also to see on the other hand they write the same about diogenes for we ought not even by the appearance of the body to deter the multitude from philosophy but as in other things a philosopher should show himself cheerful and tranquil so also he should in the things that relate to the body see ye men that i have nothing that i want nothing see how i am without a house and without a city and an exile if it happens to be so and without a hearth i live more free from trouble and more happily than
 all of noble birth and than the rich but look at my poor body also and observe that it is not injured by my hard way of livingbut if a man says this to me who has the appearance dress and face of a condemned man what god shall persuade me to approach philosophy if it makes men such persons far from it i would not choose to do so even if i were going to become a wise man i indeed would rather that a young man who is making his first movements towards philosophy should come to me with his hair carefully trimmed than with it dirty and rough for there is seen in him a certain notion appearance of beauty and a desire of attempt at that which is becoming and where he supposes it to be there also he strives that it shall be it is only necessary to show him what it is and to say young man you seek beauty and you do well you must know then that it grows is produced in that part of you where you have the rational faculty seek it there where you have the movements towards and the movements from things where you have th
e desires towards and the aversion from things for this is what you have in yourself of a superior kind but the poor body is naturally only earth why do you labor about it to no purpose if you shall learn nothing else you will learn from time that the body is nothing but if a man comes to me daubed with filth dirty with a moustache down to his knees what can i say to him by what kind of resemblance can i lead him on for about what has he busied himself which resembles beauty that i may be able to change him and say beauty is not in this but in that would you have me to tell him that beauty consists not in being daubed with muck but that it lies in the rational part has he any desire of beauty has he any form of it in his mind go and talk to a hog and tell him not to roll in the mud  for this reason the words of xenocrates touched polemon also since he was a lover of beauty for he entered the room having in him certain incitements ἐναύσματα to love of beauty but he looked for it in the wrong place for nature h
as not made even the animals dirty which live with man does a horse ever wallow in the mud or a well bred dog but the hog and the dirty geese and worms and spiders do which are banished furthest from human intercourse do you then being a man choose to be not as one of the animals which live with man but rather a worm or a spider will you not wash yourself somewhere some time in such manner as you choose will you not wash off the dirt from your body will you not come clean that those with whom you keep company may have pleasure in being with you but do you go with us even into the temples in such a state where it is not permitted to spit or blow the nose being a heap of spittle and of snot  what then does any man that is do i require you to ornament yourself far from it except to ornament that which we really are by nature the rational faculty the opinions the actions but as to the body only so far as purity only so far as not to give offense but if you are told that you ought not to wear garments dyed with pu
rple go and daub your cloak with muck or tear it but how shall i have a neat cloak man you have water wash it here is a youth worthy of being loved here is an old man worthy of loving and being loved in return a fit person for a man to entrust to him a sons instruction to whom daughters and young men shall come if opportunity shall so happen that the teacher shall deliver his lessons to them on a dunghill let this not be so every deviation comes from something which is in mans nature but this deviation is near being something not in mans nature  xii on attention when you have remitted your attention for a short time do not imagine this that you will recover it when you choose but let this thought be present to you that in consequence of the fault committed today your affairs must be in a worse condition for all that follows for first and what causes most trouble a habit of not attending is formed in you then a habit of deferring your attention and continually from time to time you drive away by deferring it t
he happiness of life proper behavior the being and living conformably to nature if then the procrastination of attention is profitable the complete omission of attention is more profitable but if it is not profitable why do you not maintain your attention constanttoday i choose to playwell then ought you not to play with attentioni choose to singwhat then hinders you from doing so with attention is there any part of life excepted to which attention does not extend for will you do it anything in life worse by using attention and better by not attending at all and what else of the things in life is done better by those who do not use attention does he who works in wood work better by not attending to it does the captain of a ship manage it better by not attending and is any of the smaller acts done better by inattention do you not see that when you have let your mind loose it is no longer in your power to recall it either to propriety or to modesty or to moderation but you do everything that comes into your min
d in obedience to your inclinations  to what things then ought i to attend first to those general principles and to have them in readiness and without them not to sleep not to rise not to drink not to eat not to converse associate with men that no man is master of another mans will but that in the will alone is the good and the bad no man then has the power either to procure for me any good or to involve me in any evil but i alone myself over myself have power in these things when then these things are secured to me why need i be disturbed about external things what tyrant is formidable what disease what poverty what offense from any man well i have not pleased a certain person is he then the pleasing of him my work my judgment no why then should i trouble myself about himbut he is supposed to be someone of importancehe will look to that himself and those who think so will also but i have one whom i ought to please to whom i ought to subject myself whom i ought to obey god and those who are next to him he has
 placed me with myself and has put my will in obedience to myself alone and has given me rules for the right use of it and when i follow these rules in syllogisms i do not care for any man who says anything else different in sophistical argument i care for no man why then in greater matters do those annoy me who blame me what is the cause of this perturbation nothing else than because in this matter topic i am not disciplined for all knowledge science despises ignorance and the ignorant and not only the sciences but even the arts produce any shoemaker that you please and he ridicules the many in respect to his own work business produce any carpenter  first then we ought to have these rules in readiness and to do nothing without them and we ought to keep the soul directed to this mark to pursue nothing external and nothing which belongs to others or is in the power of others but to do as he has appointed who has the power we ought to pursue altogether the things which are in the power of the will and all other
 things as it is permitted next to this we ought to remember who we are and what is our name and to endeavor to direct our duties towards the character nature of our several relations in life in this manner what is the season for singing what is the season for play and in whose presence what will be the consequence of the act whether our associates will despise us whether we shall despise them when to jeer σκῶψαι and whom to ridicule and on what occasion to comply and with whom and finally in complying how to maintain our own character but wherever you have deviated from any of these rules there is damage immediately not from anything external but from the action itself  what then is it possible to be free from faults if you do all this it is not possible but this is possible to direct your efforts incessantly to being faultless for we must be content if by never remitting this attention we shall escape at least a few errors but now when you have said tomorrow i will begin to attend you must be told that you 
are saying this today i will be shameless disregardful of time and place mean it will be in the power of others to give me pain today i will be passionate and envious see how many evil things you are permitting yourself to do if it is good to use attention tomorrow how much better is it to do so today if tomorrow it is in your interest to attend much more is it today that you may be able to do so tomorrow also and may not defer it again to the third day  xiii against or to those who readily tell their own affairs when a man has seemed to us to have talked with simplicity candor about his own affairs how is it that at last we are ourselves also induced to discover to him our own secrets and we think this to be candid behavior in the first place because it seems unfair for a man to have listened to the affairs of his neighbour and not to communicate to him also in turn our own affairs next because we think that we shall not present to them the appearance of candid men when we are silent about our own affairs in
deed men are often accustomed to say i have told you all my affairs will you tell me nothing of your own where is this donebesides we have also this opinion that we can safely trust him who has already told us his own affairs for the notion rises in our mind that this man could never divulge our affairs because he would be cautious that we also should not divulge his in this way also the incautious are caught by the soldiers at rome a soldier sits by you in a common dress and begins to speak ill of caesar then you as if you had received a pledge of his fidelity by his having begun the abuse utter yourself also what you think and then you are carried off in chains  something of this kind happens to us also generally now as this man has confidently entrusted his affairs to me shall i also do so to any man whom i meet no for when i have heard i keep silence if i am of such a disposition but he goes forth and tells all men what he has heard then if i hear what has been done if i be a man like him i resolve to be 
revenged i divulge what he has told me i both disturb others and am disturbed myself but if i remember that one man does not injure another and that every mans acts injure and profit him i secure this that i do not any thing like him but still i suffer what i do suffer through my own silly talk  true but it is unfair when you have heard the secrets of your neighbour for you in your turn to communicate nothing to himdid i ask you for your secrets my man did you communicate your affairs on certain terms that you should in return hear mine also if you are a babbler and think that all who meet you are friends do you wish me also to be like you but why if you did well in entrusting your affairs to me and it is not well for me to entrust mine to you do you wish me to be so rash it is just the same as if i had a cask which is watertight and you one with a hole in it and you should come and deposit with me your wine that i might put it into my cask and then should complain that i also did not entrust my wine to you f
or you have a cask with a hole in it how then is there any equality here you entrusted your affairs to a man who is faithful and modest to a man who thinks that his own actions alone are injurious and or useful and that nothing external is would you have me entrust mine to you a man who has dishonored his own faculty of will and who wishes to gain some small bit of money or some office or promotion in the court emperors palace even if you should be going to murder your own children like medea where in what is this equality fairness but show yourself to me to be faithful modest and steady show me that you have friendly opinions show that your cask has no hole in it and you will see how i shall not wait for you to trust me with your affairs but i myself shall come to you and ask you to hear mine for who does not choose to make use of a good vessel who does not value a benevolent and faithful adviser who will not willingly receive a man who is ready to bear a share as we may say of the difficulty of his circumst
ances and by this very act to ease the burden by taking a part of it  true but i trust you you do not trust mein the first place not even do you trust me but you are a babbler and for this reason you cannot hold anything for indeed if it is true that you trust me trust your affairs to me only but now whenever you see a man at leisure you seat yourself by him and say brother i have no friend more benevolent than you nor dearer i request you to listen to my affairs and you do this even to those who are not known to you at all but if you really trust me it is plain that you trust me because i am faithful and modest not because i have told my affairs to you allow me then to have the same opinion about you show me that if one man tells his affairs to another he who tells them is faithful and modest for if this were so i would go about and tell my affairs to every man if that would make me faithful and modest but the thing is not so and it requires no common opinions principles if then you see a man who is busy abo
ut things not dependent on his will and subjecting his will to them you must know that this man has ten thousand persons to compel and hinder him he has no need of pitch or the wheel to compel him to declare what he knows but a little girls nod if it should so happen will move him the blandishment of one who belongs to caesars court desire of a magistracy or of an inheritance and things without end of that sort you must remember then among general principles that secret discourses discourses about secret matters require fidelity and corresponding opinions but where can we now find these easily or if you cannot answer that question let someone point out to me a man who can say i care only about the things which are my own the things which are not subject to hindrance the things which are by nature free this i hold to be the nature of the good but let all other things be as they are allowed i do not concern myself
