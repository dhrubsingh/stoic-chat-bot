desire what you do not wishno manand to propose or intend or in short to make use of the appearances which present themselves can any man compel youhe cannot do this but he will hinder me when i desire from obtaining what i desireif you desire anything which is your own and one of the things which cannot be hindered how will he hinder youhe cannot in any waywho then tells you that he who desires the things that belong to another is free from hindrance  must i then not desire health by no means nor anything else that belongs to another for what is not in your power to acquire or to keep when you please this belongs to another keep then far from it not only your hands but more than that even your desires if you do not you have surrendered yourself as a slave you have subjected your neck if you admire anything not your own to everything that is dependent on the power of others and perishable to which you have conceived a likingis not my hand my ownit is a part of your own body but it is by nature earth subject t
o hindrance compulsion and the slave of everything which is stronger and why do i say your hand you ought to possess your whole body as a poor ass loaded as long as it is possible as long as you are allowed but if there be a press and a soldier should lay hold of it let it go do not resist nor murmur if you do you will receive blows and nevertheless you will also lose the ass but when you ought to feel thus with respect to the body consider what remains to be done about all the rest which is provided for the sake of the body when the body is an ass all the other things are bits belonging to the ass packsaddles shoes barley fodder let these also go get rid of them quicker and more readily than of the ass  when you have made this preparation and have practiced this disciplineto distinguish that which belongs to another from that which is your own the things which are subject to hindrance from those which are not to consider the things free from hindrance to concern yourself and those which are not free not to c
oncern yourself to keep your desire steadily fixed to the things which do concern yourself and turned from the things which do not concern yourselfdo you still fear any man no one for about what will you be afraid about the things which are your own in which consists the nature of good and evil and who has power over these things who can take them away who can impede them no man can no more than he can impede god but will you be afraid about your body and your possessions about things which are not yours about things which in no way concern you and what else have you been studying from the beginning than to distinguish between your own and not your own the things which are in your power and not in your power the things subject to hindrance and not subject and why have you come to the philosophers was it that you may nevertheless be unfortunate and unhappy you will then in this way as i have supposed you to have done be without fear and disturbance and what is grief to you for fear comes from what you expect b
ut grief from that which is present but what further will you desire for of the things which are within the power of the will as being good and present you have a proper and regulated desire but of the things which are not in the power of the will you do not desire any one and so you do not allow any place to that which is irrational and impatient and above measure hasty  when then you are thus affected towards things what man can any longer be formidable to you for what has a man which is formidable to another either when you see him or speak to him or finally are conversant with him not more than one horse has with respect to another or one dog to another or one bee to another bee things indeed are formidable to every man and when any man is able to confer these things on another or to take them away then he too becomes formidable how then is an acropolis a stronghold or fortress the seat of tyranny demolished not by the sword not by fire but by opinion for if we abolish the acropolis which is in the city c
an we abolish also that of fever and that of beautiful women can we in a word abolish the acropolis which is in us and cast out the tyrants within us whom we have daily over us sometimes the same tyrants at other times different tyrants but with this we must begin and with this we must demolish the acropolis and eject the tyrants by giving up the body the parts of it the faculties of it the possessions the reputation magisterial offices honors children brothers friends by considering all these things as belonging to others and if tyrants have been ejected from us why do i still shut in the acropolis by a wall of circumvallation at least on my account for if it still stands what does it do to me why do i still eject the tyrants guards for where do i perceive them against others they have their fasces and their spears and their swords but i have never been hindered in my will nor compelled when i did not will and how is this possible i have placed my movements towards action ὁρμήν in obedience to god is it his 
will that i shall have fever it is my will also is it his will that i should move towards anything it is my will also is it his will that i should obtain anything it is my wish also does he not will i do not wish is it his will that i die is it his will that i be put to the rack it is my will then to die it is my will then to be put to the rack who then is still able to hinder me contrary to my own judgment or to compel me no more than he can hinder or compel zeus  thus the more cautious of travellers also act a traveller has heard that the road is infested by robbers he does not venture to enter on it alone but he waits for the companionship on the road either of an ambassador or of a quaestor or of a proconsul and when he has attached himself to such persons he goes along the road safely so in the world the wise man acts there are many companies of robbers tyrants storms difficulties losses of that which is dearest where is there any place of refuge how shall he pass along without being attacked by robbers 
what company shall he wait for that he may pass along in safety to whom shall he attach himself to what person generally to the rich man to the man of consular rank and what is the use of that to me such a man is stripped himself groans and laments but what if the fellow companion himself turns against me and becomes my robber what shall i do i will be a friend of caesar when i am caesars companion no man will wrong me in the first place that i may become illustrious what things must i endure and suffer how often and by how many must i be robbed then if i become caesars friend he also is mortal and if caesar from any circumstance becomes my enemy where is it best for me to retire into a desert well does fever not come there what shall be done then is it not possible to find a safe fellow traveller a faithful one strong secure against all surprises thus he considers and perceives that if he attaches himself to god he will make his journey in safety  how do you understand attaching yourself to god in this sense
 that whatever god wills a man also shall will and what god does not will a man also shall not will how then shall this be done in what other way than by examining the movements ὁρμάς the acts of god and his administration what has he given to me as my own and in my own power what has he reserved to himself he has given to me the things which are in the power of the will τὰ προαιρετικὰ he has put them in my power free from impediment and hindrance how was he able to make the earthy body free from hindrance he could not and accordingly he has subjected to the revolution of the whole τῇ τῶν ὅλων περιόδῳ possessions household things house children wife why then do i fight against god why do i will what does not depend on the will why do i will to have absolutely what is not granted to me but how ought i to will to have things in the way in which they are given and as long as they are given but he who has given takes away why then do i resist i do not say that i shall be a fool if i use force to one who is strong
er but i shall first be unjust for whence had i things when i came into the worldmy father gave them to meand who gave them to him and who made the sun and who made the fruits of the earth and who the seasons and who made the connection of men with one another and their fellowship  then after receiving everything from another and even yourself are you angry and do you blame the giver if he takes anything from you who are you and for what purpose did you come into the world did not he god introduce you here did he not show you the light did he not give you fellow workers and perceptions and reason and as whom did he introduce you here did he not introduce you as subject to death and as one to live on the earth with a little flesh and to observe his administration and to join with him in the spectacle and the festival for a short time will you not then as long as you have been permitted after seeing the spectacle and the solemnity when he leads you out go with adoration of him and thanks for what you have heard
 and seenno but i would still enjoy the feastthe initiated too would wish to be longer in the initiation and perhaps also those at olympia to see other athletes but the solemnity is ended go away like a grateful and modest man make room for others others also must be born as you were and being born they must have a place and houses and necessary things and if the first do not retire what remains why are you insatiable why are you not content why do you contract the worldyes but i would have my little children with me and my wifewhat are they yours do they not belong to the giver and to him who made you then will you not give up what belongs to others will you not give way to him who is superiorwhy then did he introduce me into the world on these conditionsand if the conditions do not suit you depart he has no need of a spectator who is not satisfied he wants those who join in the festival those who take part in the chorus that they may rather applaud admire and celebrate with hymns the solemnity but those who
 can bear no trouble and the cowardly he will not unwillingly see absent from the great assembly πανήγυρις for they did not when they were present behave as they ought to do at a festival nor fill up their place properly but they lamented found fault with the deity fortune their companions not seeing both what they had and their own powers which they received for contrary purposes the powers of magnanimity of a generous mind manly spirit and what we are now inquiring about freedomfor what purpose then have i received these thingsto use themhow longso long as he who has lent them chooseswhat if they are necessary to medo not attach yourself to them and they will not be necessary do not say to yourself that they are necessary and then they are not necessary  this study you ought to practice from morning to evening beginning with the smallest things and those most liable to damage with an earthen pot with a cup then proceed in this way to a tunic to a little dog to a horse to a small estate in land then to yours
elf to your body to the parts of your body to your children to your wife to your brothers look all round and throw these things from you which are not yours purge your opinions so that nothing cleave to you of the things which are not your own that nothing grow to you that nothing give you pain when it is torn from you and say while you are daily exercising yourself as you do there in the school not that you are philosophizing for this is an arrogant offensive expression but that you are presenting an asserter of freedom for this is really freedom to this freedom diogenes was called by antisthenes and he said that he could no longer be enslaved by any man for this reason when he was taken prisoner how did he behave to the pirates did he call any of them master and i do not speak of the name for i am not afraid of the word but of the state of mind by which the word is produced how did he reprove them for feeding badly their captives how was he sold did he seek a master no but a slave and when he was sold how d
id he behave to his master immediately he disputed with him and said to his master that he ought not to be dressed as he was nor shaved in such a manner and about the children he told them how he ought to bring them up and what was strange in this for if his master had bought an exercise master would he have employed him in the exercises of the palaestra as a servant or as a master and so if he had bought a physician or an architect and so in every matter it is absolutely necessary that he who has skill must be the superior of him who has not whoever then generally possesses the science of life what else must he be than master for who is master in a ship the man who governs the helm why because he who will not obey him suffers for it but a master can give me stripes can he do it then without suffering for it so i also used to think but because he cannot do it without suffering for it for this reason it is not in his power and no man can do what is unjust without suffering for it and what is the penalty for hi
m who puts his own slave in chains what do you think that is the fact of putting the slave in chainsand you also will admit this if you choose to maintain the truth that man is not a wild beast but a tame animal for when is a vine doing badly when it is in a condition contrary to its nature when is a cock just the same therefore a man also is so what then is a mans nature to bite to kick and to throw into prison and to behead no but to do good to cooperate with others to wish them well at that time then he is in a bad condition whether you chose to admit it or not when he is acting foolishly  socrates then did not fare badlyno but his judges and his accusers didnor did helvidius at rome fare badlyno but his murderer did how do you meanthe same as you do when you say that a cock has not fared badly when he has gained the victory and been severely wounded but that the cock has fared badly when he has been defeated and is unhurt nor do you call a dog fortunate who neither pursues game nor labors but when you see
 him sweating when you see him in pain and panting violently after running what paradox unusual thing do we utter if we say that the evil in everything is that which is contrary to the nature of the thing is this a paradox for do you not say this in the case of all other things why then in the case of man only do you think differently but because we say that the nature of man is tame gentle and social and faithful you will not say that this is a paradox it is notwhat then is it a paradox to say that a man is not hurt when he is whipped or put in chains or beheaded does he not if he suffers nobly come off even with increased advantage and profit but is he not hurt who suffers in a most pitiful and disgraceful way who in place of a man becomes a wolf or viper or wasp  well then let us recapitulate the things which have been agreed on the man who is not under restraint is free to whom things are exactly in that state in which he wishes them to be but he who can be restrained or compelled or hindered or thrown in
to any circumstances against his will is a slave but who is free from restraint he who desires nothing that belongs to is in the power of others and what are the things which belong to others those which are not in our power either to have or not to have or to have of a certain kind or in a certain manner therefore the body belongs to another the parts of the body belong to another possession property belongs to another if then you are attached to any of these things as your own you will pay the penalty which it is proper for him to pay who desires what belongs to another this road leads to freedom this is the only way of escaping from slavery to be able to say at last with all your soul  lead me o zeus and thou o destiny the way that i am bid by you to go but what do you say philosopher the tyrant summons you to say something which does not become you do you say it or do you not answer melet me considerwill you consider now but when you were in the school what was it which you used to consider did you not st
udy what are the things that are good and what are bad and what things are neither one nor the otheri didwhat then was our opinionthat just and honorable acts were good and that unjust and disgraceful foul acts were badis life a good thingnois death a bad thingnois prisonnobut what did we think about mean and faithless words and betrayal of a friend and flattery of a tyrantthat they are badwell then you are not considering nor have you considered nor deliberated for what is the matter for consideration is it whether it is becoming for me when i have it in my power to secure for myself the greatest of good things and not to secure for myself that is not to avoid the greatest evils a fine inquiry indeed and necessary and one that demands much deliberation man why do you mock us such an inquiry is never made if you really imagined that base things were bad and honorable things were good and that all other things were neither good nor bad you would not even have approached this enquiry nor have come near it but i
mmediately you would have been able to distinguish them by the understanding as you would do in other cases by the vision for when do you inquire if black things are white if heavy things are light and do not comprehend the manifest evidence of the senses how then do you now say that you are considering whether things which are neither good nor bad ought to be avoided more than things which are bad but you do not possess these opinions and neither do these things seem to you to be neither good nor bad but you think that they are the greatest evils nor do you think those other things mean and faithless words etc to be evils but matters which do not concern us at all for thus from the beginning you have accustomed yourself where am i in the schools and are any listening to me i am discoursing among philosophers but i have gone out of the school away with this talk of scholars and fools thus a friend is overpowered by the testimony of a philosopher thus a philosopher becomes a parasite thus he lets himself for h
ire for money thus in the senate a man does not say what he thinks in private in the school he proclaims his opinions you are a cold and miserable little opinion suspended from idle words as from a hair but keep yourself strong and fit for the uses of life and initiated by being exercised in action how do you hear the reporti do not say that your child is dead for how could you bear thatbut that your oil is spilled your wine drunk up do you act in such a way that one standing by you while you are making a great noise may say this only philosopher you say something different in the school why do you deceive us why when you are only a worm do you say that you are a man i should like to be present when some of the philosophers is lying with a woman that i might see how he is exerting himself and what words he is uttering and whether he remembers his title of philosopher and the words which he hears or says or reads  and what is this to liberty nothing else than this whether you who are rich choose or notand who 
is your evidence for thiswho else than yourselves who have a powerful master caesar and who live in obedience to his nod and motion and who faint if he only looks at you with a scowling countenance you who court old women and old men and say i cannot do this it is not in my power why is it not in your power did you not lately contend with me and say that you are free but aprulla has hindered me tell the truth then slave and do not run away from your masters nor deny nor venture to produce anyone to assert your freedom καρπιοτήν when you have so many evidences of your slavery and indeed when a man is compelled by love to do something contrary to his opinion judgment and at the same time sees the better but has not the strength to follow it one might consider him still more worthy of excuse as being held by a certain violent and in a manner a divine power but who could endure you who are in love with old women and old men and wipe the old womens noses and wash them and give them presents and also wait on them l
ike a slave when they are sick and at the same time wish them dead and question the physicians whether they are sick unto death and again when in order to obtain these great and much admired magistracies and honors you kiss the hands of these slaves of others and so you are not the slave even of free men then you walk about before me in stately fashion a praetor or a consul do i not know how you became a praetor by what means you got your consulship who gave it to you i would not even choose to live if i must live by help of felicion and endure his arrogance and servile insolence for i know what a slave is who is fortunate as he thinks and puffed up by pride  you then a man may say are you free i wish by the gods and pray to be free but i am not yet able to face my masters i still value my poor body i value greatly the preservation of it entire though i do not possess it entire but i can point out to you a free man that you may no longer seek an example diogenes was free how was he freenot because he was born
 of free parents but because he was himself free because he had cast off all the handles of slavery and it was not possible for any man to approach him nor had any man the means of laying hold of him to enslave him he had everything easily loosed everything only hanging to him if you laid hold of his property he would have rather let it go and be yours than he would have followed you for it if you had laid hold of his leg he would have let go his leg if of all his body all his poor body his intimates friends country just the same for he knew from whence he had them and from whom and on what conditions his true parents indeed the gods and his real country he would never have deserted nor would he have yielded to any man in obedience to them and to their orders nor would any man have died for his country more readily for he was not used to inquire when he should be considered to have done anything on behalf of the whole of things the universe or all the world but he remembered that everything which is done come
s from thence and is done on behalf of that country and is commanded by him who administers it therefore see what diogenes himself says and writesfor this reason he says diogenes it is in your power to speak both with the king of the persians and with archidamus the king of the lacedaemonians as you please was it because he was born of free parents i suppose all the athenians and all the lacedaemonians because they were born of slaves could not talk with them these kings as they wished but feared and paid court to them why then does he say that it is in his power because i do not consider the poor body to be my own because i want nothing because law is everything to me and nothing else is these were the things which permitted him to be free  and that you may not think that i show you the example of a man who is a solitary person who has neither wife nor children nor country nor friends nor kinsmen by whom he could be bent and drawn in various directions take socrates and observe that he had a wife and childre
n but he did not consider them as his own that he had a country so long as it was fit to have one and in such a manner as was fit friends and kinsmen also but he held all in subjection to law and to the obedience due to it for this reason he was the first to go out as a soldier when it was necessary and in war he exposed himself to danger most unsparingly and when he was sent by the tyrants to seize leon he did not even deliberate about the matter because he thought that it was a base action and he knew that he must die for his refusal if it so happened and what difference did that make to him for he intended to preserve something else not his poor flesh but his fidelity his honorable character these are things which could not be assailed nor brought into subjection then when he was obliged to speak in defense of his life did he behave like a man who had children who had a wife no but he behaved like a man who has neither and what did he do when he was ordered to drink the poison and when he had the power of 
escaping from prison and when crito said to him escape for the sake of your children what did socrates say did he consider the power of escape as an unexpected gain by no means he considered what was fit and proper but the rest he did not even look at or take into the reckoning for he did not choose he said to save his poor body but to save that which is increased and saved by doing what is just and is impaired and destroyed by doing what is unjust socrates will not save his life by a base act he who would not put the athenians to the vote when they clamoured that he should do so he who refused to obey the tyrants he who discoursed in such a manner about virtue and right behavior it is not possible to save such a mans life by base acts but he is saved by dying not by running away for the good actor also preserves his character by stopping when he ought to stop better than when he goes on acting beyond the proper time what then shall the children of socrates do if said socrates i had gone off to thessaly would
 you have taken care of them and if i depart to the world below will there be no man to take care of them see how he gives to death a gentle name and mocks it but if you and i had been in his place we should have immediately answered as philosophers that those who act unjustly must be repaid in the same way and we should have added i shall be useful to many if my life is saved and if i die i shall be useful to no man for if it had been necessary we should have made our escape by slipping through a small hole and how in that case should we have been useful to any man for where would they have been then staying or if we were useful to men while we were alive should we not have been much more useful to them by dying when we ought to die and as we ought and now socrates being dead no less useful to men and even more useful is the remembrance of that which he did or said when he was alive  think of these things these opinions these words look to these examples if you would be free if you desire the thing according
 to its worth and what is the wonder if you buy so great a thing at the price of things so many and so great for the sake of this which is called liberty some hang themselves others throw themselves down precipices and sometimes even whole cities have perished and will you not for the sake of the true and unassailable and secure liberty give back to god when he demands them the things which he has given will you not as plato says study not to die only but also to endure torture and exile and scourging and in a word to give up all which is not your own if you will not you will be a slave among slaves even if you be ten thousand times a consul and if you make your way up to the palace caesars residence you will no less be a slave and you will feel that perhaps philosophers utter words which are contrary to common opinion paradoxes as cleanthes also said but not words contrary to reason for you will know by experience that the words are true and that there is no profit from the things which are valued and eagerl
y sought to those who have obtained them and to those who have not yet obtained them there is an imagination φαντασία that when these things are come all that is good will come with them then when they are come the feverish feeling is the same the tossing to and fro is the same the satiety the desire of things which are not present for freedom is acquired not by the full possession of the things which are desired but by removing the desire and that you may know that this is true as you have labored for those things so transfer your labor to these be vigilant for the purpose of acquiring an opinion which will make you free pay court to a philosopher instead of to a rich old man be seen about a philosophers doors you will not disgrace yourself by being seen you will not go away empty nor without profit if you go to the philosopher as you ought and if not if you do not succeed try at least the trial attempt is not disgraceful  ii on familiar intimacy to this matter before all you must attend that you be never so
 closely connected with any of your former intimates or friends as to come down to the same acts as he does if you do not observe this rule you will ruin yourself but if the thought arises in your mind i shall seem disobliging to him and he will not have the same feeling towards me remember that nothing is done without cost nor is it possible for a man if he does not do the same things to be the same man that he was choose then which of the two you will have to be equally loved by those by whom you were formerly loved being the same with your former self or being superior not to obtain from your friends the same that you did before for if this is better immediately turn away to it and let not other considerations draw you in a different direction for no man is able to make progress improvement when he is wavering between opposite things but if you have preferred this one thing to all things if you choose to attend to this only to work out this only give up everything else but if you will not do this your wave
ring will produce both these results you will neither improve as you ought nor will you obtain what you formerly obtained for before by plainly desiring the things which were worth nothing you pleased your associates but you cannot excel in both kinds and it is necessary that so far as you share in the one you must fall short in the other you cannot when you do not drink with those with whom you used to drink be agreeable to them as you were before choose then whether you will be a hard drinker and pleasant to your former associates or a sober man and disagreeable to them you cannot when you do not sing with those with whom you used to sing be equally loved by them choose then in this matter also which of the two you will have for if it is better to be modest and orderly than for a man to say he is a jolly fellow give up the rest renounce it turn away from it have nothing to do with such men but if this behavior shall not please you turn altogether to the opposite become a catamite an adulterer and act accord
ingly and you will get what you wish and jump up in the theatre and bawl out in praise of the dancer but characters so different cannot be mingled you cannot act both thersites and agamemnon if you intend to be thersites you must be humpbacked and bald if agamemnon you must be tall and handsome and love those who are placed in obedience to you  iii what things we should exchange for other things keep this thought in readiness when you lose anything external what you acquire in place of it and if it be worth more never say i have had a loss neither if you have got a horse in place of an ass or an ox in place of a sheep nor a good action in place of a bit of money nor in place of idle talk such tranquillity as befits a man nor in place of lewd talk if you have acquired modesty if you remember this you will always maintain your character such as it ought to be but if you do not consider that the times of opportunity are perishing and that whatever pains you take about yourself you are going to waste them all and
 overturn them and it needs only a few things for the loss and overturning of all namely a small deviation from reason for the steerer of a ship to upset it he has no need of the same means as he has need of for saving it but if he turns it a little to the wind it is lost and if he does not do this purposely but has been neglecting his duty a little the ship is lost something of the kind happens in this case also if you only fall anodding a little all that you have up to this time collected is gone attend therefore to the appearances of things and watch over them for that which you have to preserve is no small matter but it is modesty and fidelity and constancy freedom from the affects a state of mind undisturbed freedom from fear tranquillity in a word liberty for what will you sell these things see what is the value of the things which you will obtain in exchange for thesebut shall i not obtain any such thing for itsee and if you do in return get that see what you receive in place of it i possess decency he
 possesses a tribuneship he possesses a praetorship i possess modesty but i do not make acclamations where it is not becoming i will not stand up where i ought not for i am free and a friend of god and so i obey him willingly but i must not claim seek anything else neither body nor possession nor magistracy nor good report nor in fact anything for he god does not allow me to claim seek them for if he had chosen he would have made them good for me but he has not done so and for this reason i cannot transgress his commands preserve that which is your own good in every thing and as to every other thing as it is permitted and so far as to behave consistently with reason in respect to them content with this only if you do not you will be unfortunate you will fail in all things you will be hindered you will be impeded these are the laws which have been sent from thence from god these are the orders of these laws a man ought to be an expositor to these he ought to submit not to those of masurius and cassius  iv to t
hose who are desirous of passing life in tranquillity remember that not only the desire of power and of riches makes us mean and subject to others but even the desire of tranquillity and of leisure and of travelling abroad and of learning for to speak plainly whatever the external thing may be the value which we set upon it places us in subjection to others what then is the difference between desiring to be a senator or not desiring to be one what is the difference between desiring power or being content with a private station what is the difference between saying i am unhappy i have nothing to do but i am bound to my books as a corpse or saying i am unhappy i have no leisure for reading for as salutations and power are things external and independent of the will so is a book for what purpose do you choose to read tell me for if you only direct your purpose to being amused or learning something you are a silly fellow and incapable of enduring labor but if you refer reading to the proper end what else is this 
than a tranquil and happy life εὔσοια but if reading does not secure for you a happy and tranquil life what is the use of it but it does secure this the man replies and for this reason i am vexed that i am deprived of itand what is this tranquil and happy life which any man can impede i do not say caesar or caesars friend but a crow a piper a fever and thirty thousand other things but a tranquil and happy life contains nothing so sure as continuity and freedom from obstacle now i am called to do something i will go then with the purpose of observing the measures rules which i must keep of acting with modesty steadiness without desire and aversion to things external and then that i may attend to men what they say how they are moved and this not with any bad disposition or that i may have something to blame or to ridicule but i turn to myself and ask if i also commit the same faults how then shall i cease to commit them formerly i also acted wrong but now i do not thanks to god  come when you have done these th
ings and have attended to them have you done a worse act than when you have read a thousand verses or written as many for when you eat are you grieved because you are not reading are you not satisfied with eating according to what you have learned by reading and so with bathing and with exercise why then do you not act consistently in all things both when you approach caesar and when you approach any person if you maintain yourself free from perturbation free from alarm and steady if you look rather at the things which are done and happen than are looked at yourself if you do not envy those who are preferred before you if surrounding circumstances ὕλαι do not strike you with fear or admiration what do you want books how or for what purpose for is not this the reading of books a preparation for life and is not life itself living made up of certain other things than this this is just as if an athlete should weep when he enters the stadium because he is not being exercised outside of it it was for this purpose t
hat you used to practice exercise for this purpose were used the halteres weights the dust the young men as antagonists and do you seek for those things now when it is the time of action this is just as if in the topic matter of assent when appearances present themselves some of which can be comprehended and some cannot be comprehended we should not choose to distinguish them but should choose to read what has been written about comprehension κατάληψις  what then is the reason of this the reason is that we have never read for this purpose we have never written for this purpose so that we may in our actions use in a way conformable to nature the appearances presented to us but we terminate in this in learning what is said and in being able to expound it to another in resolving a syllogism and in handling the hypothetical syllogism for this reason where our study purpose is there alone is the impediment would you have by all means the things which are not in your power be prevented then be hindered fail in your
 purpose but if we read what is written about action efforts ὁρμή not that we may see what is said about action but that we may act well if we read what is said about desire and aversion avoiding things in order that we may neither fail in our desires nor fall into that which we try to avoid if we read what is said about duty officium in order that remembering the relations of things to one another we may do nothing irrationally nor contrary to these relations we should not be vexed in being hindered as to our readings but we should be satisfied with doing the acts which are conformable to the relations and we should be reckoning not what so far we have been accustomed to reckon today i have read so many verses i have written so many but we should say today i have employed my action as it is taught by the philosophers i have not employed my desire i have used avoidance ἐκκλίσει only with respect to things which are within the power of my will i have not been afraid of such a person i have not been prevailed u
pon by the entreaties of another i have exercised my patience my abstinence my cooperation with others and so we should thank god for what we ought to thank him  but now we do not know that we also in another way are like the many another man is afraid that he shall not have power you are afraid that you will do not do so my man but as you ridicule him who is afraid that he shall not have power so ridicule yourself also for it makes no difference whether you are thirsty like a man who has a fever or have a dread of water like a man who is mad or how will you still be able to say as socrates did if so it pleases god so let it be do you think that socrates if he had been eager to pass his leisure in the lyceum or in the academy and to discourse daily with the young men would have readily served in military expeditions so often as he did and would he not have lamented and groaned wretch that i am i must now be miserable here when i might be sunning myself in the lyceum why was this your business to sun yourself 
and is it not your business to be happy to be free from hindrance free from impediment and could he still have been socrates if he had lamented in this way how would he still have been able to write paeans in his prison  in short remember this that what you shall prize which is beyond your will so far you have destroyed your will but these things are out of the power of the will not only power authority but also a private condition not only occupation business but also leisurenow then must i live in this tumultwhy do you say tumulti mean among many menwell what is the hardship suppose that you are at olympia imagine it to be a panegyris public assembly where one is calling out one thing another is doing another thing and a third is pushing another person in the baths there is a crowd and who of us is not pleased with this assembly and leaves it unwillingly be not difficult to please nor fastidious about what happensvinegar is disagreeable for it is sharp honey is disagreeable for it disturbs my habit of body 
i do not like vegetables so also i do not like leisure it is a desert i do not like a crowd it is confusionbut if circumstances make it necessary for you to live alone or with a few call it quiet and use the thing as you ought talk with yourself exercise the appearances presented to you work up your preconceptions if you fall into a crowd call it a celebration of games a panegyris a festival try to enjoy the festival with other men for what is a more pleasant sight to him who loves mankind than a number of men we see with pleasure herds of horses or oxen we are delighted when we see many ships who is pained when he sees many menbut they deafen me with their criesthen your hearing is impeded what then is this to you is then the power of making use of appearances hindered and who prevents you from using according to nature inclination to a thing and aversion from it and movement towards a thing and movement from it what tumult confusion is able to do this  do you only bear in mind the general rules what is mine
 what is not mine what is given permitted to me what does god will that i should do now what does he not will a little before he willed you to be at leisure to talk with yourself to write about these things to read to hear to prepare yourself you had sufficient time for this now he says to you come now to the contest show us what you have learned how you have practiced the athletic art how long will you be exercised alone now is the opportunity for you to learn whether you are an athlete worthy of victory or one of those who go about the world and are defeated why then are you vexed no contest is without confusion there must be many who exercise themselves for the contest many who call out to those who exercise themselves many masters many spectatorsbut my wish is to live quietlylament then and groan as you deserve to do for what other is a greater punishment than this to the untaught man and to him who disobeys the divine commands to be grieved to lament to envy in a word to be disappointed and to be unhappy
 would you not release yourself from these thingsand how shall i release myselfhave you not often heard that you ought to remove entirely desire apply aversion turning away to those things only which are within your power that you ought to give up everything body property fame books tumult power private station for whatever way you turn you are a slave you are subjected you are hindered you are compelled you are entirely in the power of others but keep the words of cleanthes in readiness  lead me o zeus and thou necessity is it your will that i should go to rome i will go to rome to gyara i will go to gyara to athens i will go to athens to prison i will go to prison if you should once say when shall a man go to athens you are undone it is a necessary consequence that this desire if it is not accomplished must make you unhappy and if it is accomplished it must make you vain since you are elated at things at which you ought not to be elated and on the other hand if you are impeded it must make you wretched beca
use you fall into that which you would not fall into give up then all these thingsathens is a good placebut happiness is much better and to be free from passions free from disturbance for your affairs not to depend on any man there is tumult at rome and visits of salutation but happiness is an equivalent for all troublesome things if then the time comes for these things why do you not take away the wish to avoid them what necessity is there to carry a burden like an ass and to be beaten with a stick but if you do not so consider that you must always be a slave to him who has it in his power to effect your release and also to impede you and you must serve him as an evil genius  there is only one way to happiness and let this rule be ready both in the morning and during the day and by night the rule is not to look towards things which are out of the power of our will to think that nothing is our own to give up all things to the divinity to fortune to make them the superintendents of these things whom zeus also 
has made so for a man to observe that only which is his own that which cannot be hindered and when we read to refer our reading to this only and our writing and our listening for this reason i cannot call the man industrious if i hear this only that he reads and writes and even if a man adds that he reads all night i cannot say so if he knows not to what he should refer his reading for neither do you say that a man is industrious if he keeps awake for a girl nor do i but if he does it reads and writes for reputation i say that he is a lover of reputation and if he does it for money i say that he is a lover of money not a lover of labor and if he does it through love of learning i say that he is a lover of learning but if he refers his labor to his own ruling power ἡγεμονικόν that he may keep it in a state conformable to nature and pass his life in that state then only do i say that he is industrious for never commend a man on account of these things which are common to all but on account of his opinions princ
iples for these are the things which belong to each man which make his actions bad or good remembering these rules rejoice in that which is present and be content with the things which come in season if you see anything which you have learned and inquired about occurring to you in your course of life or opportunely applied by you to the acts of life be delighted at it if you have laid aside or have lessened bad disposition and a habit of reviling if you have done so with rash temper obscene words hastiness sluggishness if you are not moved by what you formerly were and not in the same way as you once were you can celebrate a festival daily today because you have behaved well in one act and tomorrow because you have behaved well in another how much greater is this a reason for making sacrifices than a consulship or the government of a province these things come to you from yourself and from the gods remember this who gives these things and to whom and for what purpose if you cherish yourself in these thoughts 
do you still think that it makes any difference where you shall be happy where you shall please god are not the gods equally distant from all places do they not see from all places alike that which is going on  v against the quarrelsome and ferocious the wise and good man neither himself fights with any person nor does he allow another so far as he can prevent it and an example of this as well as of all other things is proposed to us in the life of socrates who not only himself on all occasions avoided fights quarrels but would not allow even others to quarrel see in xenophons symposium how many quarrels he settled how further he endured thrasymachus and polus and callicles how he tolerated his wife and how he tolerated his son who attempted to confute him and to cavil with him for he remembered well that no man has in his power another mans ruling principle he wished therefore for nothing else than that which was his own and what is this not that this or that man may act according to nature for that is a thi
ng which belongs to another but that while others are doing their own acts as they choose he may nevertheless be in a condition conformable to nature and live in it only doing what is his own to the end that others also may be in a state conformable to nature for this is the object always set before him by the wise and good man is it to be commander a praetor of an army no but if it is permitted him his object is in this matter to maintain his own ruling principle is it to marry no but if marriage is allowed to him in this matter his object is to maintain himself in a condition conformable to nature but if he would have his son not to do wrong or his wife he would have what belongs to another not to belong to another and to be instructed is this to learn what things are a mans own and what belongs to another how then is there left any place for fighting quarrelling to a man who has this opinion which he ought to have is he surprised at anything which happens and does it appear new to him does he not expect th
at which comes from the bad to be worse and more grievous than what actually befalls him and does he not reckon as pure gain whatever they the bad may do which falls short of extreme wickedness such a person has reviled you great thanks to him for not having struck you but he has struck me also great thanks that he did not wound you but he wounded me also great thanks that he did not kill you for when did he learn or in what school that man is a tame animal that men love one another that an act of injustice is a great harm to him who does it since then he has not learned this and is not convinced of it why shall he not follow that which seems to be for his own interest your neighbour has thrown stones have you then done anything wrong but the things in the house have been broken are you then a utensil no but a free power of will what then is given to you to do in answer to this if you are like a wolf you must bite in return and throw more stones but if you consider what is proper for a man examine your storeh
ouse see with what faculties you came into the world have you the disposition of a wild beast have you the disposition of revenge for an injury when is a horse wretched when he is deprived of his natural faculties not when he cannot crow like a cock but when he cannot run when is a dog wretched not when he cannot fly but when he cannot track his game is then a man also unhappy in this way not because he cannot strangle lions or embrace statues for he did not come into the world in the possession of certain powers from nature for this purpose but because he has lost his probity and his fidelity people ought to meet and lament such a man for the misfortunes into which he has fallen not indeed to lament because a man has been born or has died but because it has happened to him in his lifetime to have lost the things which are his own not that which he received from his father not his land and house and his inn and his slaves for not one of these things is a mans own but all belong to others are servile and subje
ct to account ὑπεύθυνα at different times given to different persons by those who have them in their power but i mean the things which belong to him as a man the marks stamps in his mind with which he came into the world such as we seek also on coins and if we find them we approve of the coins and if we do not find the marks we reject them what is the stamp on this sestertius the stamp of trajan present it it is the stamp of nero throw it away it cannot be accepted it is counterfeit so also in this case what is the stamp of his opinions it is gentleness a sociable disposition a tolerant temper a disposition to mutual affection produce these qualities i accept them i consider this man a citizen i accept him as a neighbour a companion in my voyages only see that he has not neros stamp is he passionate is he full of resentment is he faultfinding if the whim seizes him does he break the heads of those who come in his way if so why then did you say that he is a man is everything judged determined by the bare form 
if that is so say that the form in wax is an apple and has the smell and the taste of an apple but the external figure is not enough neither then is the nose enough and the eyes to make the man but he must have the opinions of a man here is a man who does not listen to reason who does not know when he is refuted he is an ass in another man the sense of shame is become dead he is good for nothing he is anything rather than a man this man seeks whom he may meet and kick or bite so that he is not even a sheep or an ass but a kind of wild beast  what then would you have me to be despisedby whom by those who know you and how shall those who know you despise a man who is gentle and modest perhaps you mean by those who do not know you what is that to you for no other artisan cares for the opinion of those who know not his artbut they will be more hostile to me for this reasonwhy do you say me can any man injure your will or prevent you from using in a natural way the appearances which are presented to you in no way 
can he why then are you still disturbed and why do you choose to show yourself afraid and why do you not come forth and proclaim that you are at peace with all men whatever they may do and laugh at those chiefly who think that they can harm you these slaves you can say know not either who i am nor where lies my good or my evil because they have no access to the things which are mine  in this way also those who occupy a strong city mock the besiegers and say what trouble these men are now taking for nothing our wall is secure we have food for a very long time and all other resources these are the things which make a city strong and impregnable but nothing else than his opinions makes a mans soul impregnable for what wall is so strong or what body is so hard or what possession is so safe or what honor rank character so free from assault as a mans opinions all other things everywhere are perishable easily taken by assault and if any man in any way is attached to them he must be disturbed expect what is bad he mu
st fear lament find his desires disappointed and fall into things which he would avoid then do we not choose to make secure the only means of safety which are offered to us and do we not choose to withdraw ourselves from that which is perishable and servile and to labor at the things which are imperishable and by nature free and do we not remember that no man either hurts another or does good to another but that a mans opinion about each thing is that which hurts him is that which overturns him this is fighting this is civil discord this is war that which made eteocles and polynices enemies was nothing else than this opinion which they had about royal power their opinion about exile that the one is the extreme of evils the other the greatest good now this is the nature of every man to seek the good to avoid the bad to consider him who deprives us of the one and involves us in the other an enemy and treacherous even if he be a brother or a son or a father for nothing is more akin to us than the good therefore 
if these things externals are good and evil neither is a father a friend to sons nor a brother to a brother but all the world is everywhere full of enemies treacherous men and sycophants but if the will προαίρεσις the purpose the intention being what it ought to be is the only good and if the will being such as it ought not to be is the only evil where is there any strife where is there reviling about what about the things which do not concern us and strife with whom with the ignorant the unhappy with those who are deceived about the chief things  remembering this socrates managed his own house and endured a very ill tempered wife and a foolish ungrateful son for in what did she show her bad temper in pouring water on his head as much as she liked and in trampling on the cake sent to socrates and what is this to me if i think that these things are nothing to me but this is my business and neither tyrant shall check my will nor a master nor shall the many check me who am only one nor shall the stronger check m
e who am the weaker for this power of being free from check hindrance is given by god to every man for these opinions make love in a house family concord in a state among nations peace and gratitude to god they make a man in all things cheerful confident in externals as about things which belong to others as about things which are of no value we indeed are able to write and to read these things and to praise them when they are read but we do not even come near to being convinced of them therefore what is said of the lacedaemonians lions at home but in ephesus foxes will fit in our case also lions in the school but out of it foxes  vi against those who lament over being pitied i am grieved a man says at being pitied whether then is the fact of your being pitied a thing which concerns you or those who pity you well is it in your power to stop this pityit is in my power if i show them that i do not require pityand whether then are you in the condition of not deserving requiring pity or are you not in that condit
ioni think that i am not but these persons do not pity me for the things for which if they ought to pity me it would be proper i mean for my faults but they pity me for my poverty for not possessing honorable offices for diseases and deaths and other such thingswhether then are you prepared to convince the many that not one of these things is an evil but that it is possible for a man who is poor and has no office ἀνάρχοντι and enjoys no honor to be happy or to show yourself to them as rich and in power for the second of these things belong to a man who is boastful silly and good for nothing and consider by what means the pretence must be supported it will be necessary for you to hire slaves and to possess a few silver vessels and to exhibit them in public if it is possible though they are often the same and to attempt to conceal the fact that they are the same and to have splendid garments and all other things for display and to show that you are a man honored by the great and to try to sup at their houses or
 to be supposed to sup there and as to your person to employ some mean arts that you may appear to be more handsome and nobler than you are these things you must contrive if you choose to go by the second path in order not to be pitied but the first way is both impracticable and long to attempt the very thing which zeus has not been able to do to convince all men what things are good and bad is this power given to you this only is given to you to convince yourself and you have not convinced yourself then i ask you do you attempt to persuade other men and who has lived so long with you as you with yourself and who has so much power of convincing you as you have of convincing yourself and who is better disposed and nearer to you than you are to yourself how then have you not yet convinced yourself in order to learn at present are not things upside down is this what you have been earnest about doing to learn to be free from grief and free from disturbance and not to be humbled abject and to be free have you not 
heard then that there is only one way which leads to this end to give up dismiss the things which do not depend on the will to withdraw from them and to admit that they belong to others for another man then to have an opinion about you of what kind is itit is a thing independent of the willthen is it nothing to youit is nothingwhen then you are still vexed at this and disturbed do you think that you are convinced about good and evil  will you not then letting others alone be to yourself both scholar and teacherthe rest of mankind will look after this whether it is to their interest to be and to pass their lives in a state contrary to nature but to me no man is nearer than myself what then is the meaning of this that i have listened to the words of the philosophers and i assent to them but in fact i am no way made easier more content am i so stupid and yet in all other things such as i have chosen i have not been found very stupid but i learned letters quickly and to wrestle and geometry and to resolve syllogi
