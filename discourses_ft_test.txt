be good at another time bad and have you not at one time a friendly feeling towards them and at another time the feeling of an enemy and do you not at one time praise them and at another time blame them yes i have these feelings also well then do you think that he who has been deceived about a man is his friend certainly not and he who has selected a man as his friend and is of a changeable disposition has he good will towards him he has not and he who now abuses a man and afterwards admires him this man also has no good will to the other well then did you never see little dogs caressing and playing with one another so that you might say there is nothing more friendly but that you may know what friendship is throw a bit of flesh among them and you will learn throw between yourself and your son a little estate and you will know how soon he will wish to bury you and how soon you wish your son to die then you will change your tone and say what a son i have brought up he has long been wishing to bury me throw a s
mart girl between you and do you the old man love her and the young one will love her too if a little fame intervene or dangers it will be just the same you will utter the words of the father of admetus  life gives you pleasure and why not your father do you think that admetus did not love his own child when he was little that he was not in agony when the child had a fever that he did not often say i wish i had the fever instead of the child then when the test the thing came and was near see what words they utter were not eteocles and polynices from the same mother and from the same father were they not brought up together had they not lived together drunk together slept together and often kissed one another so that if any man i think had seen them he would have ridiculed the philosophers for the paradoxes which they utter about friendship but when a quarrel rose between them about the royal power as between dogs about a bit of meat see what they say  polynices	where will you take your station before the towe
rs eteocles	why do you ask me this polynices	i will place myself opposite and try to kill you eteocles	i also wish to do the same such are the wishes that they utter  for universally be not deceived every animal is attached to nothing so much as to its own interest whatever then appears to it an impediment to this interest whether this be a brother or a father or a child or beloved or lover it hates spurns curses for its nature is to love nothing so much as its own interest this is father and brother and kinsman and country and god when then the gods appear to us to be an impediment to this we abuse them and throw down their statues and burn their temples as alexander ordered the temples of aesculapius to be burned when his dear friend died  for this reason if a man put in the same place his interest sanctity goodness and country and parents and friends all these are secured but if he puts in one place his interest in another his friends and his country and his kinsmen and justice itself all these give way be
ing borne down by the weight of interest for where the i and the mine are placed to that place of necessity the animal inclines if in the flesh there is the ruling power if in the will it is there and if it is in externals it is there if then i am there where my will is then only shall i be a friend such as i ought to be and son and father for this will be my interest to maintain the character of fidelity of modesty of patience of abstinence of active cooperation of observing my relations towards all but if i put myself in one place and honesty in another then the doctrine of epicurus becomes strong which asserts either that there is no honesty or it is that which opinion holds to be honest virtuous  it was through this ignorance that the athenians and the lacedaemonians quarrelled and the thebans with both and the great king quarrelled with hellas and the macedonians with both and the romans with the getae and still earlier the trojan war happened for these reasons alexander was the guest of menelaus and if 
any man had seen their friendly disposition he would not have believed anyone who said that they were not friends but there was cast between them as between dogs a bit of meat a handsome woman and about her war arose and now when you see brothers to be friends appearing to have one mind do not conclude from this anything about their friendship not even if they swear it and say that it is impossible for them to be separated from one another for the ruling principle of a bad man cannot be trusted it is insecure has no certain rule by which it is directed and is overpowered at different times by different appearances but examine not what other men examineif they are born of the same parents and brought up together and under the same pedagoguebut examine this only wherein they place their interest whether in externals or in the will if in externals do not name them friends no more than name them trustworthy or constant or brave or free do not name them even men if you have any judgment for that is not a principle
 of human nature which makes them bite one another and abuse one another and occupy deserted places or public places as if they were mountains and in the courts of justice display the acts of robbers nor yet that which makes them intemperate and adulterers and corrupters nor that which makes them do whatever else men do against one another through this one opinion only that of placing themselves and their interests in the things which are not within the power of their will but if you hear that in truth these men think the good to be only there where will is and where there is a right use of appearances no longer trouble yourself whether they are father or son or brothers or have associated a long time and are companions but when you have ascertained this only confidently declare that they are friends as you declare that they are faithful that they are just for where else is friendship than where there is fidelity and modesty where there is a communion of honest things and of nothing else  but you may say such
 a one treated me with regard so long and did he not love me how do you know slave if he did not regard you in the same way as he wipes his shoes with a sponge or as he takes care of his beast how do you know when you have ceased to be useful as a vessel he will not throw you away like a broken platter but this woman is my wife and we have lived together so long and how long did eriphyle live with amphiaraus and was the mother of children and of many but a necklace came between them and what is a necklace it is the opinion about such things that was the bestial principle that was the thing which broke asunder the friendship between husband and wife that which did not allow the woman to be a wife nor the mother to be a mother and let every man among you who has seriously resolved either to be a friend himself or to have another for his friend cut out these opinions hate them drive them from his soul and thus first of all he will not reproach himself he will not be at variance with himself he will not change hi
s mind he will not torture himself in the next place to another also who is like himself he will be altogether and completely a friend but he will bear with the man who is unlike himself he will be kind to him gentle ready to pardon on account of his ignorance on account of his being mistaken in things of the greatest importance but he will be harsh to no man being well convinced of platos doctrine that every mind is deprived of truth unwillingly if you cannot do this yet you can do in all other respects as friends dodrink together and lodge together and sail togetherand you may be born of the same parentsfor snakes also arebut neither will they be friends nor you so long as you retain these bestial and cursed opinions  xxiii on the power of speaking every man will read a book with more pleasure or even with more ease if it is written in fairer characters therefore every man will also listen more readily to what is spoken if it is signified by appropriate and becoming words we must not say then that there is 
no faculty of expression for this affirmation is the characteristic of an impious and also of a timid man of an impious man because he undervalues the gifts which come from god just as if he would take away the commodity of the power of vision or of hearing or of seeing has then god given you eyes to no purpose and to no purpose has he infused into them a spirit so strong and of such skillful contrivance as to reach a long way and to fashion the forms of things which are seen what messenger is so swift and vigilant and to no purpose has he made the interjacent atmosphere so efficacious and elastic that the vision penetrates through the atmosphere which is in a manner moved and to no purpose has he made light without the presence of which there would be no use in any other thing  man be neither ungrateful for these gifts nor yet forget the things which are superior to them but indeed for the power of seeing and hearing and indeed for life itself and for the things which contribute to support it for the fruits 
which are dry and for wine and oil give thanks to god but remember that he has given you something else better than all these i mean the power of using them proving them and estimating the value of each for what is that which gives information about each of these powers what each of them is worth is it each faculty itself did you ever hear the faculty of vision saying anything about itself or the faculty of hearing or wheat or barley or a horse or a dog no but they are appointed as ministers and slaves to serve the faculty which has the power of making use of the appearances of things and if you inquire what is the value of each thing of whom do you inquire who answers you how then can any other faculty be more powerful than this which uses the rest as ministers and itself proves each and pronounces about them for which of them knows what itself is and what is its own value which of them knows when it ought to employ itself and when not what faculty is it which opens and closes the eyes and turns them away fr
om objects to which it ought not to apply them and does apply them to other objects is it the faculty of vision no but it is the faculty of the will what is that faculty which closes and opens the ears what is that by which they are curious and inquisitive or on the contrary unmoved by what is said is it the faculty of hearing it is no other than the faculty of the will will this faculty then seeing that it is amidst all the other faculties which are blind and dumb and unable to see anything else except the very acts for which they are appointed in order to minister to this faculty and serve it but this faculty alone sees sharp and sees what is the value of each of the rest will this faculty declare to us that anything else is the best or that itself is and what else does the eye do when it is opened than see but whether we ought to look on the wife of a certain person and in what manner who tells us the faculty of the will and whether we ought to believe what is said or not to believe it and if we do believe
 whether we ought to be moved by it or not who tells us is it not the faculty of the will but this faculty of speaking and of ornamenting words if there is indeed any such peculiar faculty what else does it do when there happens to be discourse about a thing than to ornament the words and arrange them as hairdressers do the hair but whether it is better to speak or to be silent and better to speak in this way or that way and whether this is becoming or not becoming and the season for each and the use what else tells us than the faculty of the will would you have it then to come forward and condemn itself  what then it the will says if the fact is so can that which ministers be superior to that to which it ministers can the horse be superior to the rider or the dog to the huntsman or the instrument to the musician or the servants to the king what is that which makes use of the rest the will what takes care of all the will what destroys the whole man at one time by hunger at another time by hanging and at anoth
er time by a precipice the will then is anything stronger in men than this and how is it possible that the things which are subject to restraint are stronger than that which is not what things are naturally formed to hinder the faculty of vision both will and things which do not depend on the faculty of the will it is the same with the faculty of hearing with the faculty of speaking in like manner but what has a natural power of hindering the will nothing which is independent of the will but only the will itself when it is perverted therefore this the will is alone vice or alone virtue  then being so great a faculty and set over all the rest let it the will come forward and tell us that the most excellent of all things is the flesh not even if the flesh itself declared that it is the most excellent would any person bear that it should say this but what is it epicurus which pronounces this which wrote about the end purpose of our being which wrote on the nature of things which wrote about the canon rule of tru
th which led you to wear a beard which wrote when it was dying that it was spending the last and a happy day was this the flesh or the will then do you admit that you possess anything superior to this the will and are you not mad are you in fact so blind and deaf  what then does any man despise the other faculties i hope not does any man say that there is no use or excellence in the speaking faculty i hope not that would be foolish impious ungrateful towards god but a man renders to each thing its due value for there is some use even in an ass but not so much as in an ox there is also use in a dog but not so much as in a slave there is also some use in a slave but not so much as in citizens there is also some use in citizens but not so much as in magistrates not indeed because some things are superior must we undervalue the use which other things have there is a certain value in the power of speaking but it is not so great as the power of the will when then i speak thus let no man think that i ask you to negl
ect the power of speaking for neither do i ask you to neglect the eyes nor the ears nor the hands nor the feet nor clothing nor shoes but if you ask me what then is the most excellent of all things what must i say i cannot say the power of speaking but the power of the will when it is right ὀρθὴ for it is this which uses the other the power of speaking and all the other faculties both small and great for when this faculty of the will is set right a man who is not good becomes good but when it fails a man becomes bad it is through this that we are unfortunate that we are fortunate that we blame one another are pleased with one another in a word it is this which if we neglect it makes unhappiness and if we carefully look after it makes happiness  but to take away the faculty of speaking and to say that there is no such faculty in reality is the act not only of an ungrateful man towards those who gave it but also of a cowardly man for such a person seems to me to fear if there is any faculty of this kind that we
 shall not be able to despise it such also are those who say that there is no difference between beauty and ugliness then it would happen that a man would be affected in the same way if he saw thersites and if he saw achilles in the same way if he saw helen and any other woman but these are foolish and clownish notions and the notions of men who know not the nature of each thing but are afraid if a man shall see the difference that he shall immediately be seized and carried off vanquished but this is the great matter to leave to each thing the power faculty which it has and leaving to it this power to see what is the worth of the power and to learn what is the most excellent of all things and to pursue this always to be diligent about this considering all other things of secondary value compared with this but yet as far as we can not neglecting all those other things for we must take care of the eyes also not as if they were the most excellent thing but we must take care of them on account of the most excelle
nt thing because it will not be in its true natural condition if it does not rightly use the other faculties and prefer some things to others  what then is usually done men generally act as a traveller would do on his way to his own country when he enters a good inn and being pleased with it should remain there man you have forgotten your purpose you were not travelling to this inn but you were passing through it but this is a pleasant inn and how many other inns are pleasant and how many meadows are pleasant yet only for passing through but your purpose is this to return to your country to relieve your kinsmen of anxiety to discharge the duties of a citizen to marry to beget children to fill the usual magistracies for you are not come to select more pleasant places but to live in these where you were born and of which you were made a citizen something of the kind takes place in the matter which we are considering since by the aid of speech and such communication as you receive here you must advance to perfec
tion and purge your will and correct the faculty which makes use of the appearances of things and since it is necessary also for the teaching delivery of theorems to be effected by a certain mode of expression and with a certain variety and sharpness some persons captivated by these very things abide in them one captivated by the expression another by syllogisms another again by sophisms and still another by some other inn πανδοκείου of the kind and there they stay and waste away as if they were among sirens  man your purpose business was to make yourself capable of using comformably to nature the appearances presented to you in your desires not to be frustrated in your aversion from things not to fall into that which you would avoid never to have no luck as one may say nor ever to have bad luck to be free not hindered not compelled conforming yourself to the administration of zeus obeying it well satisfied with this blaming no one charging no one with fault able from your whole soul to utter these verses  le
ad me o zeus and thou too destiny then having this purpose before you if some little form of expression pleases you if some theorems please you do you abide among them and choose to dwell there forgetting the things at home and do you say these things are fine who says that they are not fine but only as being a way home as inns are for what hinders you from being an unfortunate man even if you speak like demosthenes and what prevents you if you can resolve syllogisms like chrysippus from being wretched from sorrowing from envying in a word from being disturbed from being unhappy nothing you see then that these were inns worth nothing and that the purpose before you was something else when i speak thus to some persons they think that i am rejecting care about speaking or care about theorems but i am not rejecting this care but i am rejecting the abiding about these things incessantly and putting our hopes in them if a man by this teaching does harm to those who listen to him reckon me too among those who do th
is harm for i am not able when i see one thing which is most excellent and supreme to say that another is so in order to please you  xxiv to or against a person who was one of those who were not valued esteemed by him a certain person said to him epictetus frequently i desired to hear you and came to you and you never gave me any answer and now if it is possible i entreat you to say something to me do you think said epictetus that as there is an art in anything else so there is also an art in speaking and that he who has the art will speak skillfully and he who has not will speak unskillfully i do think so he then who by speaking receives benefit himself and is able to benefit others will speak skillfully but he who is rather damaged by speaking and does damage to others will he be unskilled in this art of speaking and you may find that some are damaged and others benefited by speaking and are all who hear benefited by what they hear or will you find that among them also some are benefited and some damaged th
ere are both among these also he said in this case also then those who hear skillfully are benefited and those who hear unskillfully are damaged he admitted this is there then a skill in hearing also as there is in speaking it seems so if you choose consider the matter in this way also the practice of music to whom does it belong to a musician and the proper making of a statue to whom do you think that it belongs to a statuary and the looking at a statue skillfully does this appear to you to require the aid of no art this also requires the aid of art then if speaking properly is the business of the skillful man do you see that to hear also with benefit is the business of the skillful man now as to speaking and hearing perfectly and usefully let us for the present if you please say no more for both of us are a long way from everything of the kind but i think that every man will allow this that he who is going to hear philosophers requires some amount of practice in hearing is it not so  tell me then about what
 i should talk to you about what matter are you able to listen about good and evil good and evil in what in a horse no well in an ox no what then in a man yes do we know then what a man is what the notion is which we have of him or have we our ears in any degree practiced about this matter but do you understand what nature is or can you even in any degree understand me when i say i shall use demonstration to you how do you understand this very thing what demonstration is or how anything is demonstrated or by what means or what things are like demonstration but are not demonstration do you know what is true or what is false what is consequent on a thing what is repugnant to a thing or not consistent or inconsistent but must i excite you to philosophy and how shall i show to you the repugnance in the opinions of most men through which they differ about things good and evil and about things which are profitable and unprofitable when you know not this very thing what repugnance contradiction is show me then what 
i shall accomplish by discoursing with youexcite my inclination to do this as the grass which is suitable when it is presented to a sheep moves its inclination to eat but if you present to it a stone or bread it will not be moved to eat so there are in us certain natural inclinations also to speak when the hearer shall appear to be somebody when he himself shall excite us but when he shall sit by us like a stone or like grass how can he excite a mans desire to speak does the vine say to the husbandman take care of me no but the vine by showing in itself that it will be profitable to the husbandman if he does take care of it invites him to exercise care when children are attractive and lively whom do they not invite to play with them and crawl with them and lisp with them but who is eager to play with an ass or to bray with it for though it is small it is still a little ass  why then do you say nothing to me i can only say this to you that he who knows not who he is and for what purpose he exists and what is t
his world and with whom he is associated and what things are the good and the bad and the beautiful and the ugly and who neither understands discourse nor demonstration nor what is true nor what is false and who is not able to distinguish them will neither desire according to nature nor turn away nor move towards nor intend to act nor assent nor dissent nor suspend his judgment to say all in a few words he will go about dumb and blind thinking that he is somebody but being nobody is this so now for the first time is it not the fact that ever since the human race existed all errors and misfortunes have arisen through this ignorance why did agamemnon and achilles quarrel with one another was it not through not knowing what things are profitable and not profitable does not the one say it is profitable to restore chryseis to her father and does not the other say that it is not profitable does not the one say that he ought to take the prize of another and does not the other say that he ought not did they not for t
hese reasons forget both who they were and for what purpose they had come there oh man for what purpose did you come to gain mistresses or to fight to fight with whom the trojans or the hellenes with the trojans do you then leave hector alone and draw your sword against your own king and do you most excellent sir neglect the duties of the king you who are the peoples guardian and have such cares and are you quarrelling about a little girl with the most warlike of your allies whom you ought by every means to take care of and protect and do you become worse than inferior to a well behaved priest who treats you these fine gladiators with all respect do you see what kind of things ignorance of what is profitable does  but i also am rich are you then richer than agamemnon but i am also handsome are you then more handsome than achilles but i have also beautiful hair but had not achilles more beautiful hair and gold colored and he did not comb it elegantly nor dress it but i am also strong can you then lift so great
 a stone as hector or ajax but i am also of noble birth are you the son of a goddess mother are you the son of a father sprung from zeus what good then do these things do to him when he sits and weeps for a girl but i am an orator and was he not do you not see how he handled the most skillful of the hellenes in oratory odysseus and phoenix how he stopped their mouths  this is all that i have to say to you and i say even this not willingly why because you have not roused me for what must i look to in order to be roused as men who are expert in riding are roused by generous horses must i look to your body you treat it disgracefully to your dress that is luxurious to your behavior to your look that is the same as nothing when you would listen to a philosopher do not say to him you tell me nothing but only show yourself worthy of hearing or fit for hearing and you will see how you will move the speaker  xxv that logic is necessary when one of those who were present said persuade me that logic is necessary he repl
ied do you wish me to prove this to you the answer was yes then i must use a demonstrative form of speechthis was grantedhow then will you know if i am cheating you by my argument the man was silent do you see said epictetus that you yourself are admitting that logic is necessary if without it you cannot know so much as this whether logic is necessary or not necessary  xxvi what is the property of error every error comprehends contradiction for since he who errs does not wish to err but to be right it is plain that he does not do what he wishes for what does the thief wish to do that which is for his own interest if then the theft is not for his interest he does not do that which he wishes but every rational soul is by nature offended at contradiction and so long as it does not understand this contradiction it is not hindered from doing contradictory things but when it does understand the contradiction it must of necessity avoid the contradiction and avoid it as much as a man must dissent from the false when 
he sees that a thing is false but so long as this falsehood does not appear to him he assents to it as to truth  he then is strong in argument and has the faculty of exhorting and confuting who is able to show to each man the contradiction through which he errs and clearly to prove how he does not do that which he wishes and does that which he does not wish for if anyone shall show this a man will himself withdraw from that which he does but so long as you do not show this do not be surprised if a man persists in his practice for having the appearance of doing right he does what he does for this reason socrates also trusting to this power used to say i am used to call no other witness of what i say but i am always satisfied with him with whom i am discussing and i ask him to give his opinion and call him as a witness and though he is only one he is sufficient in the place of all for socrates knew by what the rational soul is moved just like a pair of scales and then it must incline whether it chooses or not s
how the rational governing faculty a contradiction and it will withdraw from it but if you do not show it rather blame yourself than him who is not persuaded
