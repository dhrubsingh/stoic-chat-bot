ot be increased and strengthened by corresponding acts  in this manner certainly as philosophers say also diseases of the mind grow up for when you have once desired money if reason be applied to lead to a perception of the evil the desire is stopped and the ruling faculty of our mind is restored to the original authority but if you apply no means of cure it no longer returns to the same state but being again excited by the corresponding appearance it is inflamed to desire quicker than before and when this takes place continually it is henceforth hardened made callous and the disease of the mind confirms the love of money for he who has had a fever and has been relieved from it is not in the same state that he was before unless he has been completely cured something of the kind happens also in diseases of the soul certain traces and blisters are left in it and unless a man shall completely efface them when he is again lashed on the same places the lash will produce not blisters weals but sores if then you wis

 willing and gives signs and sends messages and if she also fondle me and come close to me and i should abstain and be victorious that would be a sophism beyond that which is named the liar and the quiescent over such a victory as this a man may justly be proud not for proposing the master sophism  how then shall this be done be willing at length to be approved by yourself be willing to appear beautiful to god desire to be in purity with your own pure self and with god then when any such appearance visits you plato says have recourse to expiations go a suppliant to the temples of the averting deities it is even sufficient if you resort to the society of noble and just men and compare yourself with them whether you find one who is living or dead go to socrates and see him lying down with alcibiades and mocking his beauty consider what a victory he at last found that he had gained over himself what an olympian victory in what number he stood from hercules so that by the gods one may justly salute him hail wondr

ingship for freedom for happiness for freedom from perturbation remember god call on him as a helper and protector as men at sea call on the dioscuri in a storm for what is a greater storm than that which comes from appearances which are violent and drive away the reason for the storm itself what else is it but an appearance for take away the fear of death and suppose as many thunders and lightnings as you please and you will know what calm and serenity there is in the ruling faculty but if you have once been defeated and say that you will conquer hereafter and then say the same again be assured that you will at last be in so wretched a condition and so weak that you will not even know afterwards that you are doing wrong but you will even begin to make apologies defenses for your wrongdoing and then you will confirm the saying of hesiod to be true  with constant ills the dilatory strives xix against those who embrace philosophical opinions only in words the argument called the ruling argument ὁ κυριεύων λόγος
 appears to have been proposed from such principles as these there is in fact a common contradiction between one another in these three propositions each two being in contradiction to the third the propositions are that everything past must of necessity be true that an impossibility does not follow a possibility and that a thing is possible which neither is nor will be true diodorus observing this contradiction employed the probative force of the first two for the demonstration of this proposition that nothing is possible which is not true and never will be now another will hold these two that something is possible which is neither true nor ever will be and that an impossibility does not follow a possibility but he will not allow that everything which is past is necessarily true as the followers of cleanthes seem to think and antipater copiously defended them but others maintain the other two propositions that a thing is possible which is neither true nor will be true and that everything which is past is nece
ssarily true but then they will maintain that an impossibility can follow a possibility but it is impossible to maintain these three propositions because of their common contradiction  if then any man should ask me which of these propositions do you maintain i will answer him that i do not know but i have received this story that diodorus maintained one opinion the followers of panthoides i think and cleanthes maintained another opinion and those of chrysippus a third what then is your opinion i was not made for this purpose to examine the appearances that occur to me and to compare what others say and to form an opinion of my own on the thing therefore i differ not at all from the grammarian who was hectors father priam who were his brothers alexander and deiphobus who was their mother hecubai have heard this story from whom from homer and hellanicus also i think writes about the same things and perhaps others like him and what further have i about the ruling argument nothing but if i am a vain man especiall
y at a banquet i surprise the guests by enumerating those who have written on these matters both chrysippus has written wonderfully in his first book about possibilities and cleanthes has written specially on the subject and archedemus antipater also has written not only in his work about possibilities but also separately in his work on the ruling argument have you not read the work i have not read it read and what profit will a man have from it he will be more trifling and impertinent than he is now for what else have you gained by reading it what opinion have you formed on this subject none but you will tell us of helen and priam and the island of calypso which never was and never will be and in this matter indeed it is of no great importance if you retain the story but have formed no opinion of your own but in matters of morality ethic this happens to us much more than in these things of which we are speaking  speak to me about good and evil listen  the wind from ilium to ciconian shores brought me odyssey
 ix  of things some are good some are bad and others are indifferent the good then are the virtues and the things which partake of the virtues the bad are the vices and the things which partake of them and the indifferent are the things which lie between the virtues and the vices wealth health life death pleasure pain whence do you know this hellanicus says it in his egyptian history for what difference does it make to say this or to say that diogenes has it in his ethic or chrysippus or cleanthes have you then examined any of these things and formed an opinion of your own show how you are used to behave in a storm on shipboard do you remember this division distinction of things when the sail rattles and a man who knows nothing of times and seasons stands by you when you are screaming and says tell me i ask you by the gods what you were saying just now is it a vice to suffer shipwreck does it participate in vice will you not take up a stick and lay it on his head what have we to do with you man we are perishi
ng and you come to mock us but if caesar send for you to answer a charge do you remember the distinction if when you are going in pale and trembling a person should come up to you and say why do you tremble man what is the matter about which you are engaged does caesar who sits within give virtue and vice to those who go in to him you reply why do you also mock me and add to my present sorrows still tell me philosopher tell me why you tremble is it not death of which you run the risk or a prison or pain of the body or banishment or disgrace what else is there is there any vice or anything which partakes of vice what then did you use to say of these things what have you to do with me man my own evils are enough for me and you say right your own evils are enough for you your baseness your cowardice your boasting which you showed when you sat in the school why did you decorate yourself with what belonged to others why did you call yourself a stoic  observe yourselves thus in your actions and you will find to wha
t sect you belong you will find that most of you are epicureans a few peripatetics and those feeble for wherein will you show that you really consider virtue equal to everything else or even superior but show me a stoic if you can where or how but you can show me an endless number who utter small arguments of the stoics for do the same persons repeat the epicurean opinions any worse and the peripatetic do they not handle them also with equal accuracy who then is a stoic as we call a statue phidiac which is fashioned according to the art of phidias so show me a man who is fashioned according to the doctrines which he utters show me a man who is sick and happy in danger and happy dying and happy in exile and happy in disgrace and happy show him i desire by the gods to see a stoic you cannot show me one fashioned so but show me at least one who is forming who has shown a tendency to be a stoic do me this favor do not grudge an old man seeing a sight which i have not seen yet do you think that you must show me th
e zeus of phidias or the athena a work of ivory and gold let any of you show me a human soul ready to think as god does and not to blame either god or man ready not to be disappointed about anything not to consider himself damaged by anything not to be angry not to be envious not to be jealous and why should i not say it direct desirous from a man to become a god and in this poor mortal body thinking of his fellowship with zeus show me the man but you cannot why then do you delude yourselves and cheat others and why do you put on a guise which does not belong to you and walk about being thieves and pilferers of these names and things which do not belong to you  and now i am your teacher and you are instructed in my school and i have this purpose to make you free from restraint compulsion hindrance to make you free prosperous happy looking to god in everything small and great and you are here to learn and practice these things why then do you not finish the work if you also have such a purpose as you ought to 
have and if i in addition to the purpose also have such qualification as i ought to have what is that which is wanting when i see an artificer and material lying by him i expect the work here then is the artificer here the material what is it that we want is not the thing one that can be taught it is is it not then in our power the only thing of all that is in our power neither wealth is in our power nor health nor reputation nor in a word anything else except the right use of appearances this right use is by nature free from restraint this alone is free from impediment why then do you not finish the work tell me the reason for it is either through my fault that you do not finish it or through your own fault or through the nature of the thing the thing itself is possible and the only thing in our power it remains then that the fault is either in me or in you or what is nearer the truth in both well then are you willing that we begin at last to bring such a purpose into this school and to take no notice of the
 past let us only make a beginning trust to me and you will see  xx against the epicureans and academics the propositions which are true and evident are of necessity used even by those who contradict them and a man might perhaps consider it to be the greatest proof of a thing being evident that it is found to be necessary even for him who denies it to make use of it at the same time for instance if a man should deny that there is anything universally true it is plain that he must make the contradictory negation that nothing is universally true what wretch do you not admit even this for what else is this than to affirm that whatever is universally affirmed is false again if a man should come forward and say know that there is nothing that can be known but all things are incapable of sure evidence or if another say believe me and you will be the better for it that a man ought not to believe anything or again if another should say learn from me man that it is not possible to learn anything i tell you this and wi
ll teach you if you choose now in what respect do these differ from those whom shall i name those who call themselves academics men agree with us that no man agrees with another believe us that no man believes anybody  thus epicurus also when he designs to destroy the natural fellowship of mankind at the same time makes use of that which he destroys for what does he say be not deceived men nor be led astray nor be mistaken there is no natural fellowship among rational animals believe me but those who say otherwise deceive you and seduce you by false reasonswhat is this to you permit us to be deceived will you fare worse if all the rest of us are persuaded that there is a natural fellowship among us and that it ought by all means to be preserved nay it will be much better and safer for you man why do you trouble yourself about us why do you keep awake for us why do you light your lamp why do you rise early why do you write so many books that no one of us may be deceived about the gods and believe that they tak
e care of men or that no one may suppose the nature of good to be other than pleasure for if this is so lie down and sleep and lead the life of a worm of which you judged yourself worthy eat and drink and enjoy women and ease yourself and snore and what is it to you how the rest shall think about these things whether right or wrong for what have we to do with you you take care of sheep because they supply us with wool and milk and last of all with their flesh would it not be a desirable thing if men could be lulled and enchanted by the stoics and sleep and present themselves to you and to those like you to be shorn and milked for this you ought to say to your brother epicureans but ought you not to conceal it from others and particularly before everything to persuade them that we are by nature adapted for fellowship that temperance is a good thing in order that all things may be secured for you or ought we to maintain this fellowship with some and not with others with whom then ought we to maintain it with su
ch as on their part also maintain it or with such as violate this fellowship and who violate it more than you who establish such doctrines  what then was it that waked epicurus from his sleepiness and compelled him to write what he did write what else was it than that which is the strongest thing in men nature which draws a man to her own will though he be unwilling and complaining for since she says you think that there is no community among mankind write this opinion and leave it for others and break your sleep to do this and by your own practice condemn your own opinions shall we then say that orestes was agitated by the erinyes furies and roused from his deep sleep and did not more savage erinyes and pains rouse epicurus from his sleep and not allow him to rest but compelled him to make known his own evils as madness and wine did the galli the priests of cybele so strong and invincible is mans nature for how can a vine be moved not in the manner of a vine but in the manner of an olive tree or on the other
 hand how can an olive tree be moved not in the manner of an olive tree but in the manner of a vine it is impossible it cannot be conceived neither then is it possible for a man completely to lose the movements affects of a man and even those who are deprived of their genital members are not able to deprive themselves of mans desires thus epicurus also mutilated all the offices of a man and of a father of a family and of a citizen and of a friend but he did not mutilate human desires for he could not not more than the lazy academics can cast away or blind their own senses though they have tried with all their might to do it what a shame is this when a man has received from nature measures and rules for the knowing of truth and does not strive to add to these measures and rules and to improve them but just the contrary endeavors to take away and destroy whatever enables us to discern the truth  what say you philosopher piety and sanctity what do you think that they are if you like i will demonstrate that they 
are good things well demonstrate it that our citizens may be turned and honor the deity and may no longer be negligent about things of the highest value have you then the demonstrations i have and i am thankful since then you are well pleased with them hear the contrary that there are no gods and if there are they take no care of men nor is there any fellowship between us and them and that this piety and sanctity which is talked of among most men is the lying of boasters and sophists or certainly of legislators for the purpose of terrifying and checking wrongdoers well done philosopher you have done something for our citizens you have brought back all the young men to contempt of things divine what then does not this satisfy you learn now that justice is nothing that modesty is folly that a father is nothing a son nothing well done philosopher persist persuade the young men that we may have more with the same opinions as you and who say the same as you from such principles as these have grown our well constit
uted states by these was sparta founded lycurgus fixed these opinions in the spartans by his laws and education that neither is the servile condition more base than honorable nor the condition of free men more honorable than base and that those who died at thermopylae died from these opinions and through what other opinions did the athenians leave their city then those who talk thus marry and beget children and employ themselves in public affairs and make themselves priests and interpreters of whom of gods who do not exist and they consult the pythian priestess that they may hear lies and they report the oracles to others monstrous impudence and imposture  man what are you doing are you refuting yourself every day and will you not give up these frigid attempts when you eat where do you carry your hand to to your mouth or to your eye when you wash yourself what do you go into do you ever call a pot a dish or a ladle a spit if i were a slave of any of these men even if i must be flayed by him daily i would rack
 him if he said boy throw some olive oil into the bath i would take pickle sauce and pour it down on his head what is this he would say an appearance was presented to me i swear by your genius which could not be distinguished from oil and was exactly like it here give me the barley drink tisane he says i would fill and carry him a dish of sharp sauce did i not ask for the barley drink yes mister this is the barley drink take it and smell take it and taste how do you know then if our senses deceive usif i had three or four fellowslaves of the same opinion i should force him to hang himself through passion or to change his mind but now they mock us by using all the things which nature gives and in words destroying them  grateful indeed are men and modest who if they do nothing else are daily eating bread and yet are shameless enough to say we do not know if there is a demeter or her daughter persephone or a pluto not to mention that they are enjoying the night and the day the seasons of the year and the stars a
nd the sea and the land and the cooperation of mankind and yet they are not moved in any degree by these things to turn their attention to them but they only seek to belch out their little problem matter for discussion and when they have exercised their stomach to go off to the bath but what they shall say and about what things or to what persons and what their hearers shall learn from this talk they care not even in the least degree nor do they care if any generous youth after hearing such talk should suffer any harm from it nor after he has suffered harm should lose all the seeds of his generous nature nor if we should give an adulterer help towards being shameless in his acts nor if a public peculator should lay hold of some cunning excuse from these doctrines nor if another who neglects his parents should be confirmed in his audacity by this teachingwhat then in your opinion is good or bad this or thatwhy then should a man say any more in reply to such persons as these or give them any reason or listen to
 any reason from them or try to convince them by zeus one might much sooner expect to make catamites change their mind than those who are become so deaf and blind to their own evils  xxi of inconsistency some things men readily confess and other things they do not no one then will confess that he is a fool or without understanding but quite the contrary you will hear all men saying i wish that i had fortune equal to my understanding but men readily confess that they are timid and they say i am rather timid i confess but as to other respects you will not find me to be foolish a man will not readily confess that he is intemperate and that he is unjust he will not confess at all he will by no means confess that he is envious or a busybody most men will confess that they are compassionate what then is the reasonthe chief thing the ruling thing is inconsistency and confusion in the things which relate to good and evil but different men have different reasons and generally what they imagine to be base they do not c
onfess at all but they suppose timidity to be a characteristic of a good disposition and compassion also but silliness to be the absolute characteristic of a slave and they do not at all admit confess the things which are offenses against society but in the case of most errors for this reason chiefly they are induced to confess them because they imagine that there is something involuntary in them as in timidity and compassion and if a man confess that he is in any respect intemperate he alleges love or passion as an excuse for what is involuntary but men do not imagine injustice to be at all involuntary there is also in jealousy as they suppose something involuntary and for this reason they confess to jealousy also  living then among such men who are so confused so ignorant of what they say and of the evils which they have or have not and why they have them or how they shall be relieved of them i think it is worth the trouble for a man to watch constantly and to ask whether i also am one of them what imaginat
ion i have about myself how i conduct myself whether i conduct myself as a prudent man whether i conduct myself as a temperate man whether i ever say this that i have been taught to be prepared for everything that may happen have i the consciousness which a man who knows nothing ought to have that i know nothing do i go to my teacher as men go to oracles prepared to obey or do i like a snivelling boy go to my school to learn history and understand the books which i did not understand before and if it should happen so to explain them also to othersman you have had a fight in the house with a poor slave you have turned the family upside down you have frightened the neighbours and you come to me as if you were a wise man and you take your seat and judge how i have explained some word and how i have babbled whatever came into my head you come full of envy and humbled because you bring nothing from home and you sit during the discussion thinking of nothing else than how your father is disposed towards you and your
 brother what are they saying about me there now they think that i am improving and are saying he will return with all knowledge i wish i could learn everything before i return but much labor is necessary and no one sends me anything and the baths at nicopolis are dirty everything is bad at home and bad here  then they say no one gains any profit from the schoolwhy who comes to the school who comes for the purpose of being improved who comes to present his opinions to be purified who comes to learn what he is in want of why do you wonder then if you carry back from the school the very things which you bring into it for you come not to lay aside your principles or to correct them or to receive other principles in place of them by no means nor anything like it you rather look to this whether you possess already that for which you come you wish to prattle about theorems what then do you not become greater triflers do not your little theorems give you some opportunity of display you solve sophistical syllogisms d
o you not examine the assumptions of the syllogism named the liar do you not examine hypothetical syllogisms why then are you still vexed if you receive the things for which you come to the school yes but if my child die or my brother or if i must die or be racked what good will these things do mewell did you come for this for this do you sit by my side did you ever for this light your lamp or keep awake or when you went out to the walking place did you ever propose any appearance that had been presented to you instead of a syllogism and did you and your friends discuss it together where and when then you say theorems are useless to whom to such as make a bad use of them for eyesalves are not useless to those who use them as they ought and when they ought fomentations are not useless dumbbells are not useless but they are useless to some useful to others if you ask me now if syllogisms are useful i will tell you that they are useful and if you choose i will prove ithow then will they in any way be useful to m
e man did you ask if they are useful to you or did you ask generally let him who is suffering from dysentery ask me if vinegar is useful i will say that it is usefulwill it then be useful to mei will say no seek first for the discharge to be stopped and the ulcers to be closed and do you o men first cure the ulcers and stop the discharge be tranquil in your mind bring it free from distraction into the school and you will know what power reason has  xxii on friendship what a man applies himself to earnestly that he naturally loves do men then apply themselves earnestly to the things which are bad by no means well do they apply themselves to things which in no way concern themselves not to these either it remains then that they employ themselves earnestly only about things which are good and if they are earnestly employed about things they love such things also whoever then understands what is good can also know how to love but he who cannot distinguish good from bad and things which are neither good nor bad fr
om both how can he possess the power of loving to love then is only in the power of the wise  how is this a man may say i am foolish and yet i love my childi am surprised indeed that you have begun by making the admission that you are foolish for what are you deficient in can you not make use of your senses do you not distinguish appearances do you not use food which is suitable for your body and clothing and habitation why then do you admit that you are foolish it is in truth because you are often disturbed by appearances and perplexed and their power of persuasion often conquers you and sometimes you think these things to be good and then the same things to be bad and lastly neither good nor bad and in short you grieve fear envy are disturbed you are changed this is the reason why you confess that you are foolish and are you not changeable in love but wealth and pleasure and in a word things themselves do you sometimes think them to be good and sometimes bad and do you not think the same men at one time to
