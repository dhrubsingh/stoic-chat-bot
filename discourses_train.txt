introduction very little is known of the life of epictetus it is said that he was a native of hierapolis in phrygia a town between the maeander and a branch of the maeander named the lycus hierapolis is mentioned in the epistle of paul to the people of colossae colossians  from which it has been concluded that there was a christian church in hierapolis in the time of the apostle the date of the birth of epictetus is unknown the only recorded fact of his early life is that he was a slave in rome and his master was epaphroditus a profligate freedman of the emperor nero there is a story that the master broke his slaves leg by torturing him but it is better to trust to the evidence of simplicius the commentator on the encheiridion or manual who says that epictetus was weak in body and lame from an early age it is not said how he became a slave but it has been asserted in modern times that the parents sold the child i have not however found any authority for this statement  it may be supposed that the young slave 
showed intelligence for his master sent or permitted him to attend the lectures of gaius musonius rufus an eminent stoic philosopher it may seem strange that such a master should have wished to have his slave made into a philosopher but jean jacques gamier the author of a mémoire sur les ouvrages depictète explains this matter very well in a communication to johann schweighäuser gamier says epictetus born at hierapolis of phrygia of poor parents was indebted apparently for the advantages of a good education to the whim which was common at the end of the republic and under the first emperors among the great of rome to reckon among their numerous slaves grammarians poets rhetoricians and philosophers in the same way as rich financiers in these later ages have been led to form at a great cost rich and numerous libraries this supposition is the only one which can explain to us how a wretched child born as poor as irus had received a good education and how a rigid stoic was the slave of epaphroditus one of the off
icers of the imperial guard for we cannot suspect that it was through predilection for the stoic doctrine and for his own use that the confidant and the minister of the debaucheries of nero would have desired to possess such a slave  some writers assume that epictetus was manumitted by his master but i can find no evidence for this statement epaphroditus accompanied nero when he fled from rome before his enemies and he aided the miserable tyrant in killing himself domitian suetonius domitian  afterwards put epaphroditus to death for this service to nero we may conclude that epictetus in some way obtained his freedom and that he began to teach at rome but after the expulsion of the philosophers from rome by domitian  ad he retired to nicopolis in epirus a city built by augustus to commemorate the victory at actium epictetus opened a school or lecture room at nicopolis where he taught till he was an old man the time of his death is unknown epictetus was never married as we learn from lucian life of the philosop
her demonax note by tiberius hemsterhusius when epictetus was finding fault with demonax and advising him to take a wife and beget children for this also as epictetus said was a philosophers duty to leave in place of himself another in the universe denionax refuted the doctrine by answering give me then epictetus one of your own daughters simplicius says commentary on epictetuss enchiridion chapter  page  schweighäuser edition that epictetus lived alone a long time at last he took a woman into his house as a nurse for a child which one of epictetus friends was going to expose on account of his poverty but epictetus took the child and brought it up  epictetus wrote nothing and all that we have under his name was written by an affectionate pupil arrian afterwards the historian of alexander the great who as he tells us took down in writing the philosophers discourses the epistle of arrian to lucius gellius these discourses formed eight books but only four are extant under the title of ἐπικτήτου διατριβαί simplic
ius in his commentary on the ἐγχειρίδιον or manual states that this work also was put together by arrian who selected from the discourses of epictetus what he considered to be most useful and most necessary and most adapted to move mens minds simplicius also says that the contents of the encheiridion are found nearly altogether and in the same words in various parts of the discourses arrian also wrote a work on the life and death of epictetus the events of the philosophers studious life were probably not many nor remarkable but we should have been glad if this work had been preserved which told as simplicius says what kind of man epictetus was  photius bibliotheca  mentions among arrians works conversations with epictetus ὁμιλίαι ἐπικτήτου in twelve books upton thinks that this work is only another name for the discourses and that photius has made the mistake of taking the conversations to be a different work from the discourses yet photius has enumerated eight books of the discourses and twelve books of the 
conversations schweighäuser observes that photius had not seen these works of arrian on epictetus for so he concludes from the brief notice of these works by photius the fact is that photius does not say that he had read these books as he generally does when he is speaking of the books which he enumerates in his bibliotheca the conclusion is that we are not certain that there was a work of arrian entitled the conversations of epictetus  the discourses of epictetus with the encheiridion and fragments were translated into english by the learned lady mrs elizabeth carter who is said to have lived to the age of eightynine the fourth edition  contains the translators last additions and alterations there is an introduction to this translation which contains a summary view of the stoic philosophy for the purpose of explaining epictetus and also there are notes to the translation the editor of this fourth edition says that the introduction and notes of the christian translator of epictetus are in the estimation of mo
st readers not the least valuable parts of the work and he adds this was also the opinion of the late archbishop seeker who though he thought very highly of the philosophy of epictetus considered the introduction and notes as admirably calculated to prevent any mistake concerning it as well as to amend and instruct the world the introduction is certainly useful though it is not free from errors i do not think that the notes are valuable i have used some of them without any remarks and i have used others and made some remarks on them where i thought that mrs carter was mistaken in her opinion of the original text or on other matters  the translation of mrs carter is good and perhaps no englishman at that time would have made a better translation i intended at first to revise mrs carters translation and to correct any errors that i might discover i had revised about half of it when i found that i was not satisfied with my work and i was advised by a learned friend to translate the whole myself this was rather a
 great undertaking for an old man who is now past seventysix i have however done the work with great care and as well as i could i have always compared my translation with the latin version and with mrs carters and i think that this is the best way of avoiding errors such as any translator may make a man who has not attempted to translate a greek or latin author does not know the difficulty of the undertaking that which may appear plain when he reads often becomes very difficult when he tries to express it in another language it is true that epictetus is generally intelligible but the style or manner of the author or we may say of arrian who attempted to produce what he heard is sometimes made obscure by the continual use of questions and answers to them and for other reasons  upton remarks in a note on book iii chapter  that there are many passages in these dissertations which are ambiguous or rather confused on account of the small questions and because the matter is not expanded by oratorical copiousness n
ot to mention other causes the discourses of epictetus it is supposed were spoken extempore and so one thing after another would come into the thoughts of the speaker wolf schweighaeuser also observes in a note volume  page  of his edition that the connection of the discourse is sometimes obscure through the omission of some words which are necessary to indicate the connection of the thoughts the reader then will find that he cannot always understand epictetus if he does not read him very carefully and some passages more than once he must also think and reflect or he will miss the meaning i do not say that the book is worth all this trouble every man must judge for himself but i should not have translated the book if i had not thought it worth study and i think that all books of this kind require careful reading if they are worth reading at all  the text of epictetus is sometimes corrupted and this corruption causes a few difficulties however these difficulties are not numerous enough to cause or to admit muc
h variety or diversity in the translations of the text this remark will explain why many parts of my translation are the same or nearly the same as mrs carters when this happened i did not think it necessary to alter my translation in order that it might not be the same as hers i made my translation first and then compared it with mrs carters and the latin version i hope that i have not made many blunders i do not suppose that i have made none  the last and best edition of the discourses the encheiridion and the fragments is by johann johann schweighäuser in  volums octavo this edition contains the commentary of simplicius on the encheiridion and two volumes of useful notes on the discourses these notes are selected from those of wolf upton and a few from other commentators but a large part are by schweighäuser himself who was an excellent scholar and a very sensible man i have read all these notes and i have used them many of the notes to the translation are my own  preface arrian to lucius gellius with wish
es for his happiness i neither wrote these discourses of epictetus in the way in which a man might write such things nor did i make them public myself inasmuch as i declare that i did not even write them but whatever i heard him say the same i attempted to write down in his own words as nearly as possible for the purpose of preserving them as memorials to myself afterwards of the thoughts and the freedom of speech of epictetus accordingly the discourses are naturally such as a man would address without preparation to another not such as a man would write with the view of others reading them now being such i do not know how they fell into the hands of the public without either my consent or my knowledge but it concerns me little if i shall be considered incompetent to write and it concerns epictetus not at all if any man shall despise his words for at the time when he uttered them it was plain that he had no other purpose than to move the minds of his hearers to the best things if indeed these discourses shoul
d produce this effect they will have i think the result which the words of philosophers ought to have but if they shall not let those who read them know that when epictetus delivered them the hearer could not avoid being affected in the way that epictetus wished him to be but if the discourses themselves as they are written do not effect this result it may be that the fault is mine or it may be that the thing is unavoidable  farewell  discourses  book i i of the things which are in our power and not in our power of all the faculties except that which i shall soon mention you will find not one which is capable of contemplating itself and consequently not capable either of approving or disapproving how far does the grammatic art possess the contemplating power as far as forming a judgment about what is written and spoken and how far music as far as judging about melody does either of them then contemplate itself by no means but when you must write something to your friend grammar will tell you what words you sh
ould write but whether you should write or not grammar will not tell you and so it is with music as to musical sounds but whether you should sing at the present time and play on the lute or do neither music will not tell you what faculty then will tell you that which contemplates both itself and all other things and what is this faculty the rational faculty for this is the only faculty that we have received which examines itself what it is and what power it has and what is the value of this gift and examines all other faculties for what else is there which tells us that golden things are beautiful for they do not say so themselves evidently it is the faculty which is capable of judging of appearances what else judges of music grammar and the other faculties proves their uses and points out the occasions for using them nothing else  as then it was fit to be so that which is best of all and supreme over all is the only thing which the gods have placed in our power the right use of appearances but all other thin
gs they have not placed in our power was it because they did not choose i indeed think that if they had been able they would have put these other things also in our power but they certainly could not for as we exist on the earth and are bound to such a body and to such companions how was it possible for us not to be hindered as to these things by externals  but what says zeus epictetus if it were possible i would have made both your little body and your little property free and not exposed to hindrance but now be not ignorant of this this body is not yours but it is clay finely tempered and since i was not able to do for you what i have mentioned i have given you a small portion of us this faculty of pursuing an object and avoiding it and the faculty of desire and aversion and in a word the faculty of using the appearances of things and if you will take care of this faculty and consider it your only possession you will never be hindered never meet with impediments you will not lament you will not blame you wi
ll not flatter any person  well do these seem to you small matters i hope not be content with them then and pray to the gods but now when it is in our power to look after one thing and to attach ourselves to it we prefer to look after many things and to be bound to many things to the body and to property and to brother and to friend and to child and to slave since then we are bound to many things we are depressed by them and dragged down for this reason when the weather is not fit for sailing we sit down and torment ourselves and continually look out to see what wind is blowing it is north what is that to us when will the west wind blow when it shall choose my good man or when it shall please aeolus for god has not made you the manager of the winds but aeolus what then we must make the best use that we can of the things which are in our power and use the rest according to their nature what is their nature then as god may please  must i then alone have my head cut off what would you have all men lose their hea
ds that you may be consoled will you not stretch out your neck as lateranus did at rome when nero ordered him to be beheaded for when he had stretched out his neck and received a feeble blow which made him draw it in for a moment he stretched it out again and a little before when he was visited by epaphroditus neros freedman who asked him about the cause of offense which he had given he said if i choose to tell anything i will tell your master  what then should a man have in readiness in such circumstances what else than this what is mine and what is not mine and what is permitted to me and what is not permitted to me i must die must i then die lamenting i must be put in chains must i then also lament i must go into exile does any man then hinder me from going with smiles and cheerfulness and contentment tell me the secret which you possess i will not for this is in my power but i will put you in chains man what are you talking about me in chains you may fetter my leg but my will not even zeus himself can ove
rpower i will throw you into prison my poor body you mean i will cut your head off when then have i told you that my head alone cannot be cut off these are the things which philosophers should meditate on which they should write daily in which they should exercise themselves  thrasea used to say i would rather be killed today than banished tomorrow what then did rufus say to him if you choose death as the heavier misfortune how great is the folly of your choice but if as the lighter who has given you the choice will you not study to be content with that which has been given to you  what then did agrippinus say he said i am not a hindrance to myself when it was reported to him that his trial was going on in the senate he said i hope it may turn out well but it is the fifth hour of the daythis was the time when he was used to exercise himself and then take the cold bathlet us go and take our exercise after he had taken his exercise one comes and tells him you have been condemned to banishment he replies or to d
eath to banishment what about my property it is not taken from you let us go to aricia then he said and dine  this it is to have studied what a man ought to study to have made desire aversion free from hindrance and free from all that a man would avoid i must die if now i am ready to die if after a short time i now dine because it is the dinnerhour after this i will then die how like a man who gives up what belongs to another  ii how a man on every occasion can maintain his proper character to the rational animal only is the irrational intolerable but that which is rational is tolerable blows are not naturally intolerable how is that see how the lacedaemonians endure whipping when they have learned that whipping is consistent with reason to hang yourself is not intolerable when then you have the opinion that it is rational you go and hang yourself in short if we observe we shall find that the animal man is pained by nothing so much as by that which is irrational and on the contrary attracted to nothing so muc
h as to that which is rational  but the rational and the irrational appear such in a different way to different persons just as the good and the bad the profitable and the unprofitable for this reason particularly we need discipline in order to learn how to adapt the preconception of the rational and the irrational to the several things conformably to nature but in order to determine the rational and the irrational we use not only the estimates of external things but we consider also what is appropriate to each person for to one man it is consistent with reason to hold a chamber pot for another and to look to this only that if he does not hold it he will receive stripes and he will not receive his food but if he shall hold the pot he will not suffer anything hard or disagreeable but to another man not only does the holding of a chamber pot appear intolerable for himself but intolerable also for him to allow another to do this office for him if then you ask me whether you should hold the chamber pot or not i s
hall say to you that the receiving of food is worth more than the not receiving of it and the being scourged is a greater indignity than not being scourged so that if you measure your interests by these things go and hold the chamber pot but this you say would not be worthy of me well then it is you who must introduce this consideration into the inquiry not i for it is you who know yourself how much you are worth to yourself and at what price you sell yourself for men sell themselves at various prices  for this reason when florus was deliberating whether he should go down to neros spectacles and also perform in them himself agrippinus said to him go down and when florus asked agrippinus why do not you go down agrippinus replied because i do not even deliberate about the matter for he who has once brought himself to deliberate about such matters and to calculate the value of external things comes very near to those who have forgotten their own character for why do you ask me the question whether death is prefe
rable or life i say life pain or pleasure i say pleasure but if i do not take a part in the tragic acting i shall have my head struck off go then and take a part but i will not why because you consider yourself to be only one thread of those which are in the tunic well then it was fitting for you to take care how you should be like the rest of men just as the thread has no design to be anything superior to the other threads but i wish to be purple that small part which is bright and makes all the rest appear graceful and beautiful why then do you tell me to make myself like the many and if i do how shall i still be purple  priscus helvidius also saw this and acted conformably for when vespasian sent and commanded him not to go into the senate he replied it is in your power not to allow me to be a member of the senate but so long as i am i must go in well go in then says the emperor but say nothing do not ask my opinion and i will be silent but i must ask your opinion and i must say what i think right but if y
ou do i shall put you to death when then did i tell you that i am immortal you will do your part and i will do mine it is your part to kill it is mine to die but not in fear yours to banish me mine to depart without sorrow  what good then did priscus do who was only a single person and what good does the purple do for the toga why what else than this that it is conspicuous in the toga as purple and is displayed also as a fine example to all other things but in such circumstances another would have replied to caesar who forbade him to enter the senate i thank you for sparing me but such a man vespasian would not even have forbidden to enter the senate for he knew that he would either sit there like an earthen vessel or if he spoke he would say what caesar wished and add even more  in this way an athlete also acted who was in danger of dying unless his private parts were amputated his brother came to the athlete who was a philosopher and said come brother what are you going to do shall we amputate this member a
nd return to the gymnasium but the athlete persisted in his resolution and died when someone asked epictetus how he did this as an athlete or a philosopher as a man epictetus replied and a man who had been proclaimed among the athletes at the olympic games and had contended in them a man who had been familiar with such a place and not merely anointed in batons school another would have allowed even his head to be cut off if he could have lived without it such is that regard to character which is so strong in those who have been accustomed to introduce it of themselves and conjoined with other things into their deliberations  come then epictetus shave yourself if i am a philosopher i answer i will not shave myself but i will take off your head if that will do you any good take it off  some person asked how then shall every man among us perceive what is suitable to his character how he replied does the bull alone when the lion has attacked discover his own powers and put himself forward in defense of the whole 
herd it is plain that with the powers the perception of having them is immediately conjoined and therefore whoever of us has such powers will not be ignorant of them now a bull is not made suddenly nor a brave man but we must discipline ourselves in the winter for the summer campaign and not rashly run upon that which does not concern us  only consider at what price you sell your own will if for no other reason at least for this that you sell it not for a small sum but that which is great and superior perhaps belongs to socrates and such as are like him why then if we are naturally such are not a very great number of us like him is it true then that all horses become swift that all dogs are skilled in tracking footprints what then since i am naturally dull shall i for this reason take no pains i hope not epictetus is not superior to socrates but if he is not inferior this is enough for me for i shall never be a milo and yet i do not neglect my body nor shall i be a croesus and yet i do not neglect my property
 nor in a word do we neglect looking after anything because we despair of reaching the highest degree  iii how a man should proceed from the principle of god being the father of all men to the rest if a man should be able to assent to this doctrine as he ought that we are all sprung from god in an especial manner and that god is the father both of men and of gods i suppose that he would never have any ignoble or mean thoughts about himself but if caesar the emperor should adopt you no one could endure your arrogance and if you know that you are the son of zeus will you not be elated yet we do not so but since these two things are mingled in the generation of man body in common with the animals and reason and intelligence in common with the gods many incline to this kinship which is miserable and mortal and some few to that which is divine and happy since then it is of necessity that every man uses everything according to the opinion which he has about it those the few who think that they are formed for fideli
ty and modesty and a sure use of appearances have no mean or ignoble thoughts about themselves but with the many it is quite the contrary for they say what am i a poor miserable man with my wretched bit of flesh wretched indeed but you possess something better than your bit of flesh why then do you neglect that which is better and why do you attach yourself to this  through this kinship with the flesh some of us inclining to it become like wolves faithless and treacherous and mischievous some become like lions savage and bestial and untamed but the greater part of us become foxes and other worse animals for what else is a slanderer and a malignant man than a fox or some other more wretched and meaner animal see then and take care that you do not become some one of these miserable things  iv of progress or improvement he who is making progress having learned from philosophers that desire means the desire of good things and aversion means aversion from bad things having learned too that happiness and tranquilli
ty are not attainable by man otherwise than by not failing to obtain what he desires and not falling into that which he would avoid such a man takes from himself desire altogether and defers it but he employs his aversion only on things which are dependent on his will for if he attempts to avoid anything independent of his will he knows that sometimes he will fall in with something which he wishes to avoid and he will be unhappy now if virtue promises good fortune and tranquillity and happiness certainly also the progress towards virtue is progress towards each of these things for it is always true that to whatever point the perfecting of anything leads us progress is an approach towards this point  how then do we admit that virtue is such as i have said and yet seek progress in other things and make a display of it what is the product of virtue tranquillity who then makes improvement is it he who has read many books of chrysippus but does virtue consist in having understood chrysippus if this is so progress 
is clearly nothing else than knowing a great deal of chrysippus but now we admit that virtue produces one thing and we declare that approaching near to it is another thing namely progress or improvement such a person says one is already able to read chrysippus by himself indeed sir you are making great progress what kind of progress but why do you mock the man why do you draw him away from the perception of his own misfortunes will you not show him the effect of virtue that he may learn where to look for improvement seek it there wretch where your work lies and where is your work in desire and in aversion that you may not be disappointed in your desire and that you may not fall into that which you would avoid in your pursuit and avoiding that you commit no error in assent and suspension of assent that you be not deceived the first things and the most necessary are those which i have named but if with trembling and lamentation you seek not to fall into that which you avoid tell me how you are improving  do you
 then show me your improvement in these things if i were talking to an athlete i should say show me your shoulders and then he might say here are my halteres you and your halteres look to that i should reply i wish to see the effect of the halteres so when you say take the treatise on the active powers ὁρμή and see how i have studied it i reply slave i am not inquiring about this but how you exercise pursuit and avoidance desire and aversion how you design and purpose and prepare yourself whether conformably to nature or not if conformably give me evidence of it and i will say that you are making progress but if not conformably be gone and not only expound your books but write such books yourself and what will you gain by it do you not know that the whole book costs only five denarii does then the expounder seem to be worth more than five denarii never then look for the matter itself in one place and progress towards it in another  where then is progress if any of you withdrawing himself from externals turns 
to his own will προαίρεσις to exercise it and to improve it by labor so as to make it conformable to nature elevated free unrestrained unimpeded faithful modest and if he has learned that he who desires or avoids the things which are not in his power can neither be faithful nor free but of necessity he must change with them and be tossed about with them as in a tempest and of necessity must subject himself to others who have the power to procure or prevent what he desires or would avoid finally when he rises in the morning if he observes and keeps these rules bathes as a man of fidelity eats as a modest man in like manner if in every matter that occurs he works out his chief principles τὰ προηγούμενα as the runner does with reference to running and the trainer of the voice with reference to the voicethis is the man who truly makes progress and this is the man who has not travelled in vain but if he has strained his efforts to the practice of reading books and labors only at this and has travelled for this i t
ell him to return home immediately and not to neglect his affairs there for this for which he has travelled is nothing but the other thing is something to study how a man can rid his life of lamentation and groaning and saying woe to me and wretched that i am and to rid it also of misfortune and disappointment and to learn what death is and exile and prison and poison that he may be able to say when he is in fetters dear crito if it is the will of the gods that it be so let it be so and not to say wretched am i an old man have i kept my grey hairs for this who is it that speaks thus do you think that i shall name some man of no repute and of low condition does not priam say this does not oedipus say this nay all kings say it for what else is tragedy than the perturbations πάθη of men who value externals exhibited in this kind of poetry but if a man must learn by fiction that no external things which are independent of the will concern us for my part i should like this fiction by the aid of which i should live
 happily and undisturbed but you must consider for yourselves what you wish  what then does chrysippus teach us the reply is to know that these things are not false from which happiness comes and tranquillity arises take my books and you will learn how true and conformable to nature are the things which make me free from perturbations o great good fortune o the great benefactor who points out the way to triptolemus all men have erected temples and altars because he gave us food by cultivation but to him who discovered truth and brought it to light and communicated it to all not the truth which shows us how to live but how to live well who of you for this reason has built an altar or a temple or has dedicated a statue or who worships god for this because the gods have given the vine or wheat we sacrifice to them but because they have produced in the human mind that fruit by which they designed to show us the truth which relates to happiness shall we not thank god for this  v against the academics if a man said
 epictetus opposes evident truths it is not easy to find arguments by which we shall make him change his opinion but this does not arise either from the mans strength or the teachers weakness for when the man though he has been confuted is hardened like a stone how shall we then be able to deal with him by argument  now there are two kinds of hardening one of the understanding the other of the sense of shame when a man is resolved not to assent to what is manifest nor to desist from contradictions most of us are afraid of mortification of the body and would contrive all means to avoid such a thing but we care not about the souls mortification and indeed with regard to the soul if a man be in such a state as not to apprehend anything or understand at all we think that he is in a bad condition but if the sense of shame and modesty are deadened this we call even power or strength  do you comprehend that you are awake i do not the man replies for i do not even comprehend when in my sleep i imagine that i am awake
 does this appearance then not differ from the other not at all he replies shall i still argue with this man and what fire or what iron shall i apply to him to make him feel that he is deadened he does perceive but he pretends that he does not he is even worse than a dead man he does not see the contradiction he is in a bad condition another does see it but he is not moved and makes no improvement he is even in a worse condition his modesty is extirpated and his sense of shame and the rational faculty has not been cut off from him but it is brutalised shall i name this strength of mind certainly not unless we also name it such in catamites through which they do and say in public whatever comes into their head  vi of providence from everything which is or happens in the world it is easy to praise providence if a man possesses these two qualities the faculty of seeing what belongs and happens to all persons and things and a grateful disposition if he does not possess these two qualities one man will not see the
 use of things which are and which happen another will not be thankful for them even if he does know them if god had made colors but had not made the faculty of seeing them what would have been their use none at all on the other hand if he had made the faculty of vision but had not made objects such as to fall under the faculty what in that case also would have been the use of it none at all well suppose that he had made both but had not made light in that case also they would have been of no use who is it then who has fitted this to that and that to this and who is it that has fitted the knife to the case and the case to the knife is it no one and indeed from the very structure of things which have attained their completion we are accustomed to show that the work is certainly the act of some artificer and that it has not been constructed without a purpose does then each of these things demonstrate the workman and do not visible things and the faculty of seeing and light demonstrate him and the existence of m
ale and female and the desire of each for conjunction and the power of using the parts which are constructed do not even these declare the workman if they do not let us consider the constitution of our understanding according to which when we meet with sensible objects we do not simply receive impressions from them but we also select something from them and subtract something and add and compound by means of them these things or those and in fact pass from some to other things which in a manner resemble them is not even this sufficient to move some men and to induce them not to forget the workman if not so let them explain to us what it is that makes each several thing or how it is possible that things so wonderful and like the contrivances of art should exist by chance and from their own proper motion  what then are these things done in us only many indeed in us only of which the rational animal had peculiarly need but you will find many common to us with irrational animals do they then understand what is do
ne by no means for use is one thing and understanding is another god had need of irrational animals to make use of appearances but of us to understand the use of appearances it is therefore enough for them to eat and to drink and to sleep and to copulate and to do all the other things which they severally do but for us to whom he has given also the intellectual faculty these things are not sufficient for unless we act in a proper and orderly manner and conformably to the nature and constitution of each thing we shall never attain our true end for where the constitutions of living beings are different there also the acts and the ends are different in those animals then whose constitution is adapted only to use use alone is enough but in an animal man which has also the power of understanding the use unless there be the due exercise of the understanding he will never attain his proper end well then god constitutes every animal one to be eaten another to serve for agriculture another to supply cheese and another
 for some like use for which purposes what need is there to understand appearances and to be able to distinguish them but god has introduced man to be a spectator of god and of his works and not only a spectator of them but an interpreter for this reason it is shameful for man to begin and to end where irrational animals do but rather he ought to begin where they begin and to end where nature ends in us and nature ends in contemplation and understanding and in a way of life conformable to nature take care then not to die without having been spectators of these things  but you take a journey to olympia to see the work of phidias and all of you think it a misfortune to die without having seen such things but when there is no need to take a journey and where a man is there he has the works of god before him will you not desire to see and understand them will you not perceive either what you are or what you were born for or what this is for which you have received the faculty of sight but you may say there are so
me things disagreeable and troublesome in life and are there none at olympia are you not scorched are you not pressed by a crowd are you not without comfortable means of bathing are you not wet when it rains have you not abundance of noise clamour and other disagreeable things but i suppose that setting all these things off against the magnificence of the spectacle you bear and endure well then and have you not received faculties by which you will be able to bear all that happens have you not received greatness of soul have you not received manliness have you not received endurance and why do i trouble myself about anything that can happen if i possess greatness of soul what shall distract my mind or disturb me or appear painful shall i not use the power for the purposes for which i received it and shall i grieve and lament over what happens  yes but my nose runs for what purpose then slave have you hands is it not that you may wipe your nose is it then consistent with reason that there should be running of n
oses in the world nay how much better it is to wipe your nose than to find fault what do you think that hercules would have been if there had not been such a lion and hydra and stag and boar and certain unjust and bestial men whom hercules used to drive away and clear out and what would he have been doing if there had been nothing of the kind is it not plain that he would have wrapped himself up and have slept in the first place then he would not have been a hercules when he was dreaming away all his life in such luxury and ease and even if he had been one what would have been the use of him and what the use of his arms and of the strength of the other parts of his body and his endurance and noble spirit if such circumstances and occasions had not roused and exercised him well then must a man provide for himself such means of exercise and seek to introduce a lion from some place into his country and a boar and a hydra this would be folly and madness but as they did exist and were found they were useful for sh
owing what hercules was and for exercising him come then do you also having observed these things look to the faculties which you have and when you have looked at them say bring now o zeus any difficulty that thou pleasest for i have means given to me by thee and powers for honoring myself through the things which happen you do not so but you sit still trembling for fear that some things will happen and weeping and lamenting and groaning for what does happen and then you blame the gods for what is the consequence of such meanness of spirit but impiety and yet god has not only given us these faculties by which we shall be able to bear everything thing happens without being depressed or broken by it but like a good king and a true father he has given us these faculties free from hindrance subject to no compulsion unimpeded and has put them entirely in our own power without even having reserved to himself any power of hindering or impeding you who have received these powers free and as your own use them not you 
do not even see what you have received and from whom some of you being blinded to the giver and not even acknowledging your benefactor and others through meanness of spirit betaking yourselves to faultfinding and making charges against god yet i will show to you that you have powers and means for greatness of soul and manliness but what powers you have for finding fault and making accusations do you show me  vii of the use of sophistical arguments and hypothetical and the like the handling of sophistical and hypothetical arguments and of those which derive their conclusions from questioning and in a word the handling of all such arguments relates to the duties of life though the many do not know this truth for in every matter we inquire how the wise and good man shall discover the proper path and the proper method of dealing with the matter let then people either say that the grave man will not descend into the contest of question and answer or that if he does descend into the contest he will take no care abo
ut not conducting himself rashly or carelessly in questioning and answering but if they do not allow either the one or the other of these things they must admit that some inquiry ought to be made into those topics τόπων on which particularly questioning and answering are employed for what is the end proposed in reasoning to establish true propositions to remove the false to withhold assent from those which are not plain is it enough then to have learned only this it is enough a man may reply is it then also enough for a man who would not make a mistake in the use of coined money to have heard this precept that he should receive the genuine drachmae and reject the spurious it is not enough what then ought to be added to this precept what else than the faculty which proves and distinguishes the genuine and the spurious drachmae consequently also in reasoning what has been said is not enough but it is necessary that a man should acquire the faculty of examining and distinguishing the true and the false and that 
which is not plain it is necessary besides this what is proposed in reasoning that you should accept what follows from that which you have properly granted well is it then enough in this case also to know this it is not enough but a man must learn how one thing is a consequence of other things and when one thing follows from one thing and when it follows from several collectively consider then if it be not necessary that this power should also be acquired by him who purposes to conduct himself skillfully in reasoning the power of demonstrating himself the several things which he has proposed and the power of understanding the demonstrations of others and of not being deceived by sophists as if they were demonstrating therefore there has arisen among us the practice and exercise of conclusive arguments and figures and it has been shown to be necessary  but in fact in some cases we have properly granted the premises or assumptions and there results from them something and though it is not true yet nonetheless i
t does result what then ought i to do ought i to admit the falsehood and how is that possible well should i say that i did not properly grant that which we agreed upon but you are not allowed to do even this shall i then say that the consequence does not arise through what has been conceded but neither is this allowed what then must be done in this case consider if it is not this as to have borrowed is not enough to make a man still a debtor but to this must be added the fact that he continues to owe the money and that the debt is not paid so it is not enough to compel you to admit the inference that you have granted the premises τὰ λήμματα but you must abide by what you have granted indeed if the premises continue to the end such as they were when they were granted it is absolutely necessary for us to abide by what we have granted and we must accept their consequences but if the premises do not remain such as they were when they were granted it is absolutely necessary for us also to withdraw from what we gra
nted and from accepting what does not follow from the words in which our concessions were made for the inference is now not our inference nor does it result with our assent since we have withdrawn from the premises which we granted we ought then both to examine such kinds of premises and such change and variation of them from one meaning to another by which in the course of questioning or answering or in making the syllogistic conclusion or in any other such way the premises undergo variations and give occasion to the foolish to be confounded if they do not see what conclusions consequences are for what reason ought we to examine in order that we may not in this matter be employed in an improper manner nor in a confused way  and the same in hypotheses and hypothetical arguments for it is necessary sometimes to demand the granting of some hypothesis as a kind of passage to the argument which follows must we then allow every hypothesis that is proposed or not allow every one and if not every one which should we
 allow and if a man has allowed a hypothesis must he in every case abide by allowing it or must he sometimes withdraw from it but admit the consequences and not admit contradictions yes but suppose that a man says if you admit the hypothesis of a possibility i will draw you to an impossibility with such a person shall a man of sense refuse to enter into a contest and avoid discussion and conversation with him but what other man than the man of sense can use argumentation and is skillful in questioning and answering and incapable of being cheated and deceived by false reasoning and shall he enter into the contest and yet not take care whether he shall engage in argument not rashly and not carelessly and if he does not take care how can he be such a man as we conceive him to be but without some such exercise and preparation can he maintain a continuous and consistent argument let them show this and all these speculations θεωρήματα become superfluous and are absurd and inconsistent with our notion of a good and 
serious man  why are we still indolent and negligent and sluggish and why do we seek pretences for not laboring and not being watchful in cultivating our reason if then i shall make a mistake in these matters may i not have killed my father slave where was there a father in this matter that you could kill him what then have you done the only fault that was possible here is the fault which you have committed this is the very remark which i made to rufus when he blamed me for not having discovered the one thing omitted in a certain syllogism i suppose i said that i have burnt the capitol slave he replied was the thing omitted here the capitol or are these the only crimes to burn the capitol and to kill your father but for a man to use the appearances presented to him rashly and foolishly and carelessly and not to understand argument nor demonstration nor sophism nor in a word to see in questioning and answering what is consistent with that which we have granted or is not consistent is there no error in this  vi
ii that the faculties are not safe to the uninstructed in as many ways as we can change things which are equivalent to one another in just so many ways we can change the forms of arguments ἐπιχειρήματα and enthymemes ἐνθυμήματα in argumentation this is an instance if you have borrowed and not repaid you owe me the money you have not borrowed and you have not repaid then you do not owe me the money to do this skillfully is suitable to no man more than to the philosopher for if the enthymeme is an imperfect syllogism it is plain that he who has been exercised in the perfect syllogism must be equally expert in the imperfect also  why then do we not exercise ourselves and one another in this manner because i reply at present though we are not exercised in these things and not distracted from the study of morality by me at least still we make no progress in virtue what then must we expect if we should add this occupation and particularly as this would not only be an occupation which would withdraw us from more nec
essary things but would also be a cause of selfconceit and arrogance and no small cause for great is the power of arguing and the faculty of persuasion and particularly if it should be much exercised and also receive additional ornament from language and so universally every faculty acquired by the uninstructed and weak brings with it the danger of these persons being elated and inflated by it for by what means could one persuade a young man who excels in these matters that he ought not to become an appendage to them but to make them an appendage to himself does he not trample on all such reasons and strut before us elated and inflated not enduring that any man should reprove him and remind him of what he has neglected and to what he has turned aside  what then was not plato a philosopher i reply and was not hippocrates a physician but you see how hippocrates speaks does hippocrates then speak thus in respect of being a physician why do you mingle things which have been accidentally united in the same men and
 if plato was handsome and strong ought i also to set to work and endeavor to become handsome or strong as if this was necessary for philosophy because a certain philosopher was at the same time handsome and a philosopher will you not choose to see and to distinguish in respect to what men become philosophers and what things belong to them in other respects and if i were a philosopher ought you also to be made lame what then do i take away these faculties which you possess by no means for neither do i take away the faculty of seeing but if you ask me what is the good of man i cannot mention to you anything else than that it is a certain disposition of the will with respect to appearances  ix how from the fact that we are akin to god a man may proceed to the consequences if the things are true which are said by the philosophers about the kinship between god and man what else remains for men to do than what socrates did never in reply to the question to what country you belong say that you are an athenian or a 
corinthian but that you are a citizen of the world κόσμιος for why do you say that you are an athenian and why do you not say that you belong to the small nook only into which your poor body was cast at birth is it not plain that you call yourself an athenian or corinthian from the place which has a greater authority and comprises not only that small nook itself and all your family but even the whole country from which the stock of your progenitors is derived down to you he then who has observed with intelligence the administration of the world and has learned that the greatest and supreme and the most comprehensive community is that which is composed of men and god and that from god have descended the seeds not only to my father and grandfather but to all beings which are generated on the earth and are produced and particularly to rational beingsfor these only are by their nature formed to have communion with god being by means of reason conjoined with himwhy should not such a man call himself a citizen of t
he world why not a son of god and why should he be afraid of anything which happens among men is kinship with caesar the emperor or with any other of the powerful in rome sufficient to enable us to live in safety and above contempt and without any fear at all and to have god for your maker ποιητήν and father and guardian shall not this release us from sorrows and fears  but a man may say whence shall i get bread to eat when i have nothing  and how do slaves and runawayson what do they rely when they leave their masters do they rely on their lands or slaves or their vessels of silver they rely on nothing but themselves and food does not fail them and shall it be necessary for one among us who is a philosopher to travel into foreign parts and trust to and rely on others and not to take care of himself and shall he be inferior to irrational animals and more cowardly each of which being selfsufficient neither fails to get its proper food nor to find a suitable way of living and one conformable to nature  i indeed
 think that the old man ought to be sitting here not to contrive how you may have no mean thoughts nor mean and ignoble talk about yourselves but to take care that there be not among us any young men of such a mind that when they have recognised their kinship to god and that we are fettered by these bondsthe body i mean and its possessions and whatever else on account of them is necessary to us for the economy and commerce of lifethey should intend to throw off these things as if they were burdens painful and intolerable and to depart to their kinsmen but this is the labor that your teacher and instructor ought to be employed upon if he really were what he should be you should come to him and say epictetus we can no longer endure being bound to this poor body and feeding it and giving it drink and rest and cleaning it and for the sake of the body complying with the wishes of these and of those are not these things indifferent and nothing to us and is not death no evil and are we not in a manner kinsmen of god
 and did we not come from him allow us to depart to the place from which we came allow us to be released at last from these bonds by which we are bound and weighed down here there are robbers and thieves and courts of justice and those who are named tyrants and think that they have some power over us by means of the body and its possessions permit us to show them that they have no power over any man and i on my part would say friends wait for god when he shall give the signal and release you from this service then go to him but for the present endure to dwell in this place where he has put you short indeed is this time of your dwelling here and easy to bear for those who are so disposed for what tyrant or what thief or what courts of justice are formidable to those who have thus considered as things of no value the body and the possessions of the body wait then do not depart without a reason  something like this ought to be said by the teacher to ingenuous youths but now what happens the teacher is a lifeless
 body and you are lifeless bodies when you have been well filled today you sit down and lament about the morrow how you shall get something to eat wretch if you have it you will have it if you have it not you will depart from life the door is open why do you grieve where does there remain any room for tears and where is there occasion for flattery why shall one man envy another why should a man admire the rich or the powerful even if they be both very strong and of violent temper for what will they do to us we shall not care for that which they can do and what we do care for that they cannot do how did socrates behave with respect to these matters why in what other way than a man ought to do who was convinced that he was a kinsman of the gods if you say to me now said socrates to his judges we will acquit you on the condition that you no longer discourse in the way in which you have hitherto discoursed nor trouble either our young or our old men i shall answer you make yourselves ridiculous by thinking that i
f one of our commanders has appointed me to a certain post it is my duty to keep and maintain it and to resolve to die a thousand times rather than desert it but if god has put us in any place and way of life we ought to desert it socrates speaks like a man who is really a kinsman of the gods but we think about ourselves as if we were only stomachs and intestines and shameful parts we fear we desire we flatter those who are able to help us in these matters and we fear them also  a man asked me to write to rome about him a man who as most people thought had been unfortunate for formerly he was a man of rank and rich but had been stripped of all and was living here i wrote on his behalf in a submissive manner but when he had read the letter he gave it back to me and said i wished for your help not your pity no evil has happened to me  thus also musonius rufus in order to try me used to say this and this will befall you from your master and when i replied that these were things which happen in the ordinary cours
e of human affairs why then said he should i ask him for anything when i can obtain it from you for in fact what a man has from himself it is superfluous and foolish to receive from another shall i then who am able to receive from myself greatness of soul and a generous spirit receive from you land and money or a magisterial office i hope not i will not be so ignorant about my own possessions but when a man is cowardly and mean what else must be done for him than to write letters as you would about a corpse please to grant us the body of a certain person and a sextarius of poor blood for such a person is in fact a carcass and a sextarius a certain quantity of blood and nothing more but if he were anything more he would know that one man is not miserable through the means of another  x against those who eagerly seek preferment at rome if we applied ourselves as busily to our own work as the old men at rome do to those matters about which they are employed perhaps we also might accomplish something i am acquain
ted with a man older than myself who is now superintendent of corn at rome and i remember the time when he came here on his way back from exile and what he said as he related the events of his former life and how he declared that with respect to the future after his return he would look after nothing else than passing the rest of his life in quiet and tranquillity for how little of life he said remains for me i replied you will not do it but as soon as you smell rome you will forget all that you have said and if admission is allowed even into the imperial palace he will gladly thrust himself in and thank god if you find me epictetus he answered setting even one foot within the palace think what you please well what then did he do before he entered the city he was met by letters from caesar and as soon as he received them he forgot all and ever after has added one piece of business to another i wish that i were now by his side to remind him of what he said when he was passing this way and to tell him how much 
better a seer i am than he is  well then do i say that man is an animal made for doing nothing certainly not but why are we not active we are active for example as to myself as soon as day comes in a few words i remind myself of what i must read over to my pupils then forthwith i say to myself but what is it to me how a certain person shall read the first thing for me is to sleep and indeed what resemblance is there between what other persons do and what we do if you observe what they do you will understand and what else do they do all day long than make up accounts enquire among themselves give and take advice about some small quantity of grain a bit of land and such kind of profits is it then the same thing to receive a petition and to read in it i entreat you to permit me to export a small quantity of corn and one to this effect i entreat you to learn from chrysippus what is the administration of the world and what place in it the rational animal holds consider also who you are and what is the nature of yo
ur good and bad are these things like the other do they require equal care and is it equally base to neglect these and those well then are we the only persons who are lazy and love sleep no but much rather you young men are for we old men when we see young men amusing themselves are eager to play with them and if i saw you active and zealous much more should i be eager myself to join you in your serious pursuits  xi of natural affection when he was visited by one of the magistrates epictetus inquired of him about several particulars and asked if he had children and a wife the man replied that he had and epictetus inquired further how he felt under the circumstances miserable the man said then epictetus asked in what respect for men do not marry and beget children in order to be wretched but rather to be happy but i the man replied am so wretched about my children that lately when my little daughter was sick and was supposed to be in danger i could not endure to stay with her but i left home till a person sent
 me news that she had recovered well then said epictetus do you think that you acted right i acted naturally the man replied but convince me of this that you acted naturally and i will convince you that everything which takes place according to nature takes place rightly this is the case said the man with all or at least most fathers i do not deny that but the matter about which we are inquiring is whether such behavior is right for in respect to this matter we must say that tumours also come for the good of the body because they do come and generally we must say that to do wrong is natural because nearly all or at least most of us do wrong do you show me then how your behavior is natural i cannot he said but do you rather show me how it is not according to nature and is not rightly done  well said epictetus if we were inquiring about white and black what criterion should we employ for distinguishing between them the sight he said and if about hot and cold and hard and soft what criterion the touch well then 
since we are inquiring about things which are according to nature and those which are done rightly or not rightly what kind of criterion do you think that we should employ i do not know he said and yet not to know the criterion of colors and smells and also of tastes is perhaps no great harm but if a man do not know the criterion of good and bad and of things according to nature and contrary to nature does this seem to you a small harm the greatest harm i think come tell me do all things which seem to some persons to be good and becoming rightly appear such and at present as to jews and syrians and egyptians and romans is it possible that the opinions of all of them in respect to food are right how is it possible he said well i suppose it is absolutely necessary that if the opinions of the egyptians are right the opinions of the rest must be wrong if the opinions of the jews are right those of the rest cannot be right certainly but where there is ignorance there also there is want of learning and training in 
things which are necessary he assented to this you then said epictetus since you know this for the future will employ yourself seriously about nothing else and will apply your mind to nothing else than to learn the criterion of things which are according to nature and by using it also to determine each several thing but in the present matter i have so much as this to aid you towards what you wish does affection to those of your family appear to you to be according to nature and to be good certainly well is such affection natural and good and is a thing consistent with reason not good by no means is then that which is consistent with reason in contradiction with affection i think not you are right for if it is otherwise it is necessary that one of the contradictions being according to nature the other must be contrary to nature is it not so it is he said whatever then we shall discover to be at the same time affectionate and also consistent with reason this we confidently declare to be right and good agreed we
ll then to leave your sick child and to go away is not reasonable and i suppose that you will not say that it is but it remains for us to inquire if it is consistent with affection yes let us consider did you then since you had an affectionate disposition to your child do right when you ran off and left her and has the mother no affection for the child certainly she has ought then the mother also to have left her or ought she not she ought not and the nurse does she love her she does ought then she also to have left her by no means and the pedagogue does he not love her he does love her ought then he also to have deserted her and so should the child have been left alone and without help on account of the great affection of you the parents and of those about her or should she have died in the hands of those who neither loved her nor cared for her certainly not now this is unfair and unreasonable not to allow those who have equal affection with yourself to do what you think to be proper for yourself to do becau
se you have affection it is absurd come then if you were sick would you wish your relations to be so affectionate and all the rest children and wife as to leave you alone and deserted by no means and would you wish to be so loved by your own that through their excessive affection you would always be left alone in sickness or for this reason would you rather pray if it were possible to be loved by your enemies and deserted by them but if this is so it results that your behavior was not at all an affectionate act  well then was it nothing which moved you and induced you to desert your child and how is that possible but it might be something of the kind which moved a man at rome to wrap up his head while a horse was running which he favored and when contrary to expectation the horse won he required sponges to recover from his fainting fit what then is the thing which moved the exact discussion of this does not belong to the present occasion perhaps but it is enough to be convinced of this if what the philosopher
s say is true that we must not look for it anywhere without but in all cases it is one and the same thing which is the cause of our doing or not doing something of saying or not saying something of being elated or depressed of avoiding anything or pursuing the very thing which is now the cause to me and to you to you of coming to me and sitting and hearing and to me of saying what i do say and what is this is it any other than our will to do so no other but if we had willed otherwise what else should we have been doing than that which we willed to do this then was the cause of achilles lamentation not the death of patroclus for another man does not behave thus on the death of his companion but it was because he chose to do so and to you this was the very cause of your then running away that you chose to do so and on the other side if you should hereafter stay with her the reason will be the same and now you are going to rome because you choose and if you should change your mind you will not go thither and in 
a word neither death nor exile nor pain nor anything of the kind is the cause of our doing anything or not doing but our own opinions and our wills δόγματα  do i convince you of this or not you do convince me such then as the causes are in each case such also are the effects when then we are doing anything not rightly from this day we shall impute it to nothing else than to the will δόγμα or opinion from which we have done it and it is that which we shall endeavor to take away and to extirpate more than the tumours and abscesses out of the body and in like manner we shall give the same account of the cause of the things which we do right and we shall no longer allege as causes of any evil to us either slave or neighbour or wife or children being persuaded that if we do not think things to be what we do think them to be we do not the acts which follow from such opinions and as to thinking or not thinking that is in our power and not in externals it is so he said from this day then we shall inquire into and exa
mine nothing else what its quality is or its state neither land nor slaves nor horses nor dogs nothing else than opinions i hope so you see then that you must become a scholasticus an animal whom all ridicule if you really intend to make an examination of your own opinions and that this is not the work of one hour or day you know yourself  xii of contentment with respect to gods there are some who say that a divine being does not exist others say that it exists but is inactive and careless and takes no forethought about anything a third class say that such a being exists and exercises forethought but only about great things and heavenly things and about nothing on the earth a fourth class say that a divine being exercises forethought both about things on the earth and heavenly things but in a general way only and not about things severally there is a fifth class to whom ulysses and socrates belong who say i move not without thy knowledge iliad x   before all other things then it is necessary to inquire about 
each of these opinions whether it is affirmed truly or not truly for if there are no gods how is it our proper end to follow them and if they exist but take no care of anything in this case also how will it be right to follow them but if indeed they do exist and look after things still if there is nothing communicated from them to men nor in fact to myself how even so is it right to follow them the wise and good man then after considering all these things submits his own mind to him who administers the whole as good citizens do to the law of the state he who is receiving instruction ought to come to be instructed with this intention how shall i follow the gods in all things how shall i be contented with the divine administration and how can i become free for he is free to whom everything happens according to his will and whom no man can hinder what then is freedom madness certainly not for madness and freedom do not consist but you say i would have everything result just as i like and in whatever way i like y
ou are mad you are beside yourself do you not know that freedom is a noble and valuable thing but for me inconsiderately to wish for things to happen as i inconsiderately like this appears to be not only not noble but even most base for how do we proceed in the matter of writing do i wish to write the name of dion as i choose no but i am taught to choose to write it as it ought to be written and how with respect to music in the same manner and what universally in every art or science just the same if it were not so it would be of no value to know anything if knowledge were adapted to every mans whim is it then in this alone in this which is the greatest and the chief thing i mean freedom that i am permitted to will inconsiderately by no means but to be instructed is this to learn to wish that everything may happen as it does and how do things happen as the disposer has disposed them and he has appointed summer and winter and abundance and scarcity and virtue and vice and all such opposites for the harmony of 
the whole and to each of us he has given a body and parts of the body and possessions and companions  remembering then this disposition of things we ought to go to be instructed not that we may change the constitution of thingsfor we have not the power to do it nor is it better that we should have the powerbut in order that as the things around us are what they are and by nature exist we may maintain our minds in harmony with the things which happen for can we escape from men and how is it possible and if we associate with them can we change them who gives us the power what then remains or what method is discovered of holding commerce with them is there such a method by which they shall do what seems fit to them and we not the less shall be in a mood which is conformable to nature but you are unwilling to endure and are discontented and if you are alone you call it solitude and if you are with men you call them knaves and robbers and you find fault with your own parents and children and brothers and neighbour
s but you ought when you are alone to call this condition by the name of tranquillity and freedom and to think yourself like to the gods and when you are with many you ought not to call it crowd nor trouble nor uneasiness but festival and assembly and so accept all contentedly  what then is the punishment of those who do not accept it is to be what they are is any person dissatisfied with being alone let him be alone is a man dissatisfied with his parents let him be a bad son and lament is he dissatisfied with his children let him be a bad father cast him into prison what prison where he is already for he is there against his will and where a man is against his will there he is in prison so socrates was not in prison for he was there willingly must my leg then be lamed wretch do you then on account of one poor leg find fault with the world will you not willingly surrender it for the whole will you not withdraw from it will you not gladly part with it to him who gave it and will you be vexed and discontented w
ith the things established by zeus which he with the moirae fates who were present and spinning the thread of your generation defined and put in order know you not how small a part you are compared with the whole i mean with respect to the body for as to intelligence you are not inferior to the gods nor less for the magnitude of intelligence is not measured by length nor yet by height but by thoughts  will you not then choose to place your good in that in which you are equal to the gods wretch that i am to have such a father and mother what then was it permitted to you to come forth and to select and to say let such a man at this moment unite with such a woman that i may be produced it was not permitted but it was a necessity for your parents to exist first and then for you to be begotten of what kind of parents of such as they were well then since they are such as they are is there no remedy given to you now if you did not know for what purpose you possess the faculty of vision you would be unfortunate and w
retched if you closed your eyes when colors were brought before them but in that you possess greatness of soul and nobility of spirit for every event that may happen and you know not that you possess them are you not more unfortunate and wretched things are brought close to you which are proportionate to the power which you possess but you turn away this power most particularly at the very time when you ought to maintain it open and discerning do you not rather thank the gods that they have allowed you to be above these things which they have not placed in your power and have made you accountable only for those which are in your power as to your parents the gods have left you free from responsibility and so with respect to your brothers and your body and possessions and death and life for what then have they made you responsible for that which alone is in your power the proper use of appearances why then do you draw on yourself the things for which you are not responsible it is indeed a giving of trouble to y
ourself  xiii how everything may be done acceptably to the gods when someone asked how may a man eat acceptably to the gods he answered if he can eat justly and contentedly and with equanimity and temperately and orderly will it not be also acceptably to the gods but when you have asked for warm water and the slave has not heard or if he did hear has brought only tepid water or he is not even found to be in the house then not to be vexed or to burst with passion is not this acceptable to the godshow then shall a man endure such persons as this slave slave yourself will you not bear with your own brother who has zeus for his progenitor and is like a son from the same seeds and of the same descent from above but if you have been put in any such higher place will you immediately make yourself a tyrant will you not remember who you are and whom you rule that they are kinsmen that they are brethren by nature that they are the offspring of zeusbut i have purchased them and they have not purchased me do you see in w
hat direction you are looking that it is towards the earth towards the pit that it is towards these wretched laws of dead men but towards the laws of the gods you are not looking  xiv that the deity oversees all things when a person asked him how a man could be convinced that all his actions are under the inspection of god he answered do you not think that all things are united in one i do the person replied well do you not think that earthly things have a natural agreement and union with heavenly things i do and how else so regularly as if by gods command when he bids the plants to flower do they flower when he bids them to send forth shoots do they shoot when he bids them to produce fruit how else do they produce fruit when he bids the fruit to ripen does it ripen when again he bids them to cast down the fruits how else do they cast them down and when to shed the leaves do they shed the leaves and when he bids them to fold themselves up and to remain quiet and rest how else do they remain quiet and rest and
 how else at the growth and the wane of the moon and at the approach and recession of the sun are so great an alteration and change to the contrary seen in earthly things but are plants and our bodies so bound up and united with the whole and are not our souls much more and our souls so bound up and in contact with god as parts of him and portions of him and does not god perceive every motion of these parts as being his own motion connate with himself now are you able to think of the divine administration and about all things divine and at the same time also about human affairs and to be moved by ten thousand things at the same time in your senses and in your understanding and to assent to some and to dissent from others and again as to some things to suspend your judgment and do you retain in your soul so many impressions from so many and various things and being moved by them do you fall upon notions similar to those first impressed and do you retain numerous arts and the memories of ten thousand things and
 is not god able to oversee all things and to be present with all and to receive from all a certain communication and is the sun able to illuminate so large a part of the all and to leave so little not illuminated that part only which is occupied by the earths shadow and he who made the sun itself and makes it go round being a small part of himself compared with the whole cannot he perceive all things  but i cannot the man may reply comprehend all these things at once but who tells you that you have equal power with zeus nevertheless he has placed by every man a guardian every mans daemon to whom he has committed the care of the man a guardian who never sleeps is never deceived for to what better and more careful guardian could he have entrusted each of us when then you have shut the doors and made darkness within remember never to say that you are alone for you are not but god is within and your daemon is within and what need have they of light to see what you are doing to this god you ought to swear an oath
 just as the soldiers do to caesar but they who are hired for pay swear to regard the safety of caesar before all things and you who have received so many and such great favors will you not swear or when you have sworn will you not abide by your oath and what shall you swear never to be disobedient never to make any charges never to find fault with anything that he has given and never unwillingly to do or to suffer anything that is necessary is this oath like the soldiers oath the soldiers swear not to prefer any man to caesar in this oath men swear to honor themselves before all  xv what philosophy promises when a man was consulting him how he should persuade his brother to cease being angry with him epictetus replied philosophy does not propose to secure for a man any external thing if it did or if it were not as i say philosophy would be allowing something which is not within its province for as the carpenters material is wood and that of the statuary is copper so the matter of the art of living is each ma
ns life what then is my brothers that again belongs to his own art but with respect to yours it is one of the external things like a piece of land like health like reputation but philosophy promises none of these in every circumstance i will maintain she says the governing part conformable to nature whose governing part his in whom i am she says  how then shall my brother cease to be angry with me bring him to me and i will tell him but i have nothing to say to you about his anger  when the man who was consulting him said i seek to know this how even if my brother is not reconciled to me shall i maintain myself in a state conformable to nature nothing great said epictetus is produced suddenly since not even the grape or the fig is if you say to me now that you want a fig i will answer to you that it requires time let it flower first then put forth fruit and then ripen is then the fruit of a figtree not perfected suddenly and in one hour and would you possess the fruit of a mans mind in so short a time and so 
easily do not expect it even if i tell you  xvi of providence do not wonder if for other animals than man all things are provided for the body not only food and drink but beds also and they have no need of shoes nor bed materials nor clothing but we require all these additional things for animals not being made for themselves but for service it was not fit for them to be made so as to need other things for consider what it would be for us to take care not only of ourselves but also about cattle and asses how they should be clothed and how shod and how they should eat and drink now as soldiers are ready for their commander shod clothed and armed but it would be a hard thing for the chiliarch tribune to go round and shoe or clothe his thousand men so also nature has formed the animals which are made for service all ready prepared and requiring no further care so one little boy with only a stick drives the cattle  but now we instead of being thankful that we need not take the same care of animals as of ourselves
 complain of god on our own account and yet in the name of zeus and the gods any one thing of those which exist would be enough to make a man perceive the providence of god at least a man who is modest and grateful and speak not to me now of the great things but only of this that milk is produced from grass and cheese from milk and wool from skins who made these things or devised them no one you say o amazing shamelessness and stupidity  well let us omit the works of nature and contemplate her smaller subordinate πάρεργα acts is there anything less useful than the hair on the chin what then has not nature used this hair also in the most suitable manner possible has she not by it distinguished the male and the female does not the nature of every man forthwith proclaim from a distance i am a man as such approach me as such speak to me look for nothing else see the signs again in the case of women as she has mingled something softer in the voice so she has also deprived them of hair on the chin you say not so th
e human animal ought to have been left without marks of distinction and each of us should have been obliged to proclaim i am a man but how is not the sign beautiful and becoming and venerable how much more beautiful than the cocks comb how much more becoming than the lions mane for this reason we ought to preserve the signs which god has given we ought not to throw them away nor to confound as much as we can the distinctions of the sexes  are these the only works of providence in us and what words are sufficient to praise them and set them forth according to their worth for if we had understanding ought we to do anything else both jointly and severally than to sing hymns and bless the deity and to tell of his benefits ought we not when we are digging and ploughing and eating to sing this hymn to god great is god who has given us such implements with which we shall cultivate the earth great is god who has given us hands the power of swallowing a stomach imperceptible growth and the power of breathing while we 
sleep this is what we ought to sing on every occasion and to sing the greatest and most divine hymn for giving us the faculty of comprehending these things and using a proper way well then since most of you have become blind ought there not to be some man to fill this office and on behalf of all to sing the hymn to god for what else can i do a lame old man than sing hymns to god if then i was a nightingale i would do the part of a nightingale if i were a swan i would do like a swan but now i am a rational creature and i ought to praise god this is my work i do it nor will i desert this post so long as i am allowed to keep it and i exhort you to join in this same song  xvii that the logical art is necessary since reason is the faculty which analyses and perfects the rest and it ought itself not to be unanalysed by what should it be analysed for it is plain that this should be done either by itself or by another thing either then this other thing also is reason or something else superior to reason which is impo
ssible but if it is reason again who shall analyse that reason for if that reason does this for itself our reason also can do it but if we shall require something else the thing will go on to infinity and have no end reason therefore is analysed by itself yes but it is more urgent to cure our opinions and the like will you then hear about those things hear but if you should say i know not whether you are arguing truly or falsely and if i should express myself in any way ambiguously and you should say to me distinguish i will bear with you no longer and i shall say to you it is more urgent this is the reason i suppose why they the stoic teachers place the logical art first as in the measuring of corn we place first the examination of the measure but if we do not determine first what is a modius and what is a balance how shall we be able to measure or weigh anything  in this case then if we have not fully learned and accurately examined the criterion of all other things by which the other things are learned sha
ll we be able to examine accurately and to learn fully anything else how is this possible yes but the modius is only wood and a thing which produces no fruitbut it is a thing which can measure cornlogic also produces no fruitas to this indeed we shall see but then even if a man should grant this it is enough that logic has the power of distinguishing and examining other things and as we may say of measuring and weighing them who says this is it only chrysippus and zeno and cleanthes and does not antisthenes say so and who is it that has written that the examination of names is the beginning of education and does not socrates say so and of whom does xenophon write that he began with the examination of names what each name signified is this then the great and wondrous thing to understand or interpret chrysippus who says thiswhat then is the wondrous thingto understand the will of nature well then do you apprehend it yourself by your own power and what more have you need of for if it is true that all men err inv
oluntarily and you have learned the truth of necessity you must act rightbut in truth i do not apprehend the will of nature who then tells us what it isthey say that it is chrysippusi proceed and i inquire what this interpreter of nature says i begin not to understand what he says i seek an interpreter of chrysippuswell consider how this is said just as if it were said in the roman tonguewhat then is this superciliousness of the interpreter there is no superciliousness which can justly be charged even to chrysippus if he only interprets the will of nature but does not follow it himself and much more is this so with his interpreter for we have no need of chrysippus for his own sake but in order that we may understand nature nor do we need a diviner sacrificer on his own account but because we think that through him we shall know the future and understand the signs given by the gods nor do we need the viscera of animals for their own sake but because through them signs are given nor do we look with wonder on th
e crow or raven but on god who through them gives signs  i go then to the interpreter of these things and the sacrificer and i say inspect the viscera for me and tell me what signs they give the man takes the viscera opens them and interprets man he says you have a will free by nature from hindrance and compulsion this is written here in the viscera i will show you this first in the matter of assent can any man hinder you from assenting to the truth no man can can any man compel you to receive what is false no man can you see that in this matter you have the faculty of the will free from hindrance free from compulsion unimpeded well then in the matter of desire and pursuit of an object is it otherwise and what can overcome pursuit except another pursuit and what can overcome desire and aversion ἔκκλισιν except another desire and aversion but you object if you place before me the fear of death you do compel me no it is not what is placed before you that compels but your opinion that it is better to do soandso 
than to die in this matter then it is your opinion that compelled you that is will compelled will for if god had made that part of himself which he took from himself and gave to us of such a nature as to be hindered or compelled either by himself or by another he would not then be god nor would he be taking care of us as he ought this says the diviner i find in the victims these are the things which are signified to you if you choose you are free if you choose you will blame no one you will charge no one all will be at the same time according to your mind and the mind of god for the sake of this divination i go to this diviner and to the philosopher not admiring him for this interpretation but admiring the things which he interprets  xviii that we ought not to be angry with the errors faults of others if what philosophers say is true that all men have one principle as in the case of assent the persuasion that a thing is so and in the case of dissent the persuasion that a thing is not so and in the case of a s
uspense of judgment the persuasion that a thing is uncertain so also in the case of a movement towards any thing the persuasion that a thing is for a mans advantage and it is impossible to think that one thing is advantageous and to desire another and to judge one thing to be proper and to move towards another why then are we angry with the many they are thieves and robbers you may say what do you mean by thieves and robbers they are mistaken about good and evil ought we then to be angry with them or to pity them but show them their error and you will see how they desist from their errors if they do not see their errors they have nothing superior to their present opinion  ought not then this robber and this adulterer to be destroyed by no means say so but speak rather in this way this man who has been mistaken and deceived about the most important things and blinded not in the faculty of vision which distinguishes white and black but in the faculty which distinguishes good and bad should we not destroy him if
 you speak thus you will see how inhuman this is which you say and that it is just as if you would say ought we not to destroy this blind and deaf man but if the greatest harm is the privation of the greatest things and the greatest thing in every man is the will or choice such as it ought to be and a man is deprived of this will why are you also angry with him man you ought not to be affected contrary to nature by the bad things of another pity him rather drop this readiness to be offended and to hate and these words which the many utter these accursed and odious fellows how have you been made so wise at once and how are you so peevish why then are we angry is it because we value so much the things of which these men rob us do not admire your clothes and then you will not be angry with the thief do not admire the beauty of your wife and you will not be angry with the adulterer learn that a thief and an adulterer have no place in the things which are yours but in those which belong to others and which are not
 in your power if you dismiss these things and consider them as nothing with whom are you still angry but so long as you value these things be angry with yourself rather than with the thief and the adulterer consider the matter thus you have fine clothes your neighbour has not you have a window you wish to air the clothes the thief does not know wherein mans good consists but he thinks that it consists in having fine clothes the very thing which you also think must he not then come and take them away when you show a cake to greedy persons and swallow it all yourself do you expect them not to snatch it from you do not provoke them do not have a window do not air your clothes i also lately had an iron lamp placed by the side of my household gods hearing a noise at the door i ran down and found that the lamp had been carried off i reflected that he who had taken the lamp had done nothing strange what then tomorrow i said you will find an earthen lamp for a man only loses that which he has i have lost my garment 
the reason is that you had a garment i have pain in my head have you any pain in your horns why then are you troubled for we only lose those things we have only pains about those things which we possess  but the tyrant will chainwhat the leg he will take awaywhat the neck what then will he not chain and not take away the will this is why the ancients taught the maxim know thyself therefore we ought to exercise ourselves in small things and beginning with them to proceed to the greater i have pain in the head do not say alas i have pain in the ear do not say alas and i do not say that you are not allowed to groan but do not groan inwardly and if your slave is slow in bringing a bandage do not cry out and torment yourself and say everybody hates me for who would not hate such a man for the future relying on these opinions walk about upright free not trusting to the size of your body as an athlete for a man ought not to be invincible in the way that an ass is  who then is the invincible it is he whom none of the
 things disturb which are independent of the will then examining one circumstance after another i observe as in the case of an athlete he has come off victorious in the first contest well then as to the second and what if there should be great heat and what if it should be at olympia and the same i say in this case if you should throw money in his way he will despise it well suppose you put a young girl in his way what then and what if it is in the dark what if it should be a little reputation or abuse and what if it should be praise and what if it should be death he is able to overcome all what then if it be in heat and what if it is in the rain and what if he be in a melancholy mad mood and what if he be asleep he will still conquer this is my invincible athlete  xix how we should behave to tyrants if a man possesses any superiority or thinks that he does when he does not such a man if he is uninstructed will of necessity be puffed up through it for instance the tyrant says i am master of all and what can y
ou do for me can you give me desire which shall have no hindrance how can you have you the infallible power of avoiding what you would avoid have you the power of moving towards an object without error and how do you possess this power come when you are in a ship do you trust to yourself or to the helmsman and when you are in a chariot to whom do you trust but to the driver and how is it in all other arts just the same in what then lies your power all men pay respect to me well i also pay respect to my platter and i wash it and wipe it and for the sake of my oil flask i drive a peg into the wall well then are these things superior to me no but they supply some of my wants and for this reason i take care of them well do i not attend to my ass do i not wash his feet do i not clean him do you not know that every man has regard to himself and to you just the same as he has regard to his ass for who has regard to you as a man show me who wishes to become like you who imitates you as he imitates socrates but i can 
cut off your head you say right i had forgotten that i must have regard to you as i would to a fever and the bile and raise an altar to you as there is at rome an altar to fever  what is it then that disturbs and terrifies the multitude is it the tyrant and his guards by no means i hope that it is not so it is not possible that what is by nature free can be disturbed by anything else or hindered by any other thing than by itself but it is a mans own opinions which disturb him for when the tyrant says to a man i will chain your leg he who values his leg says do not have pity but he who values his own will says if it appears more advantageous to you chain it do you not care i do not care i will show you that i am master you cannot do that zeus has set me free do you think that he intended to allow his own son to be enslaved but you are master of my carcass take it so when you approach me you have no regard to me no but i have regard to myself and if you wish me to say that i have regard to you also i tell you t
hat i have the same regard to you that i have to my pipkin  this is not a perverse selfregard for the animal is constituted so as to do all things for itself for even the sun does all things for itself nay even zeus himself but when he chooses to be the giver of rain and the giver of fruits and the father of gods and men you see that he cannot obtain these functions and these names if he is not useful to man and universally he has made the nature of the rational animal such that it cannot obtain any one of its own proper interests if it does not contribute something to the common interest in this manner and sense it is not unsociable for a man to do everything for the sake of himself for what do you expect that a man should neglect himself and his own interest and how in that case can there be one and the same principle in all animals the principle of attachment regard to themselves  what then when absurd notions about things independent of our will as if they were good and or bad lie at the bottom of our opi
nions we must of necessity pay regard to tyrants for i wish that men would pay regard to tyrants only and not also to the bedchamber men how is it that the man becomes all at once wise when caesar has made him superintendent of the close stool how is it that we say immediately felicion spoke sensibly to me i wish he were ejected from the bedchamber that he might again appear to you to be a fool  epaphroditus had a shoemaker whom he sold because he was good for nothing this fellow by some good luck was bought by one of caesars men and became caesars shoemaker you should have seen what respect epaphroditus paid to him how does the good felicion do i pray then if any of us asked what is master epaphroditus doing the answer was he is consulting about something with felicion had he not sold the man as good for nothing who then made him wise all at once this is an instance of valuing something else than the things which depend on the will  has a man been exalted to the tribuneship all who meet him offer their congr
atulations one kisses his eyes another the neck and the slaves kiss his hands he goes to his house he finds torches lighted he ascends the capitol he offers a sacrifice on the occasion now who ever sacrificed for having had good desires for having acted conformably to nature for in fact we thank the gods for those things in which we place our good a person was talking to me today about the priesthood of augustus i say to him man let the thing alone you will spend much for no purpose but he replies those who draw up agreements will write my name do you then stand by those who read them and say to such persons it is i whose name is written there and if you can now be present on all such occasions what will you do when you are dead my name will remain write it on a stone and it will remain but come what remembrance of you will there be beyond nicopolis but i shall wear a crown of gold if you desire a crown at all take a crown of roses and put it on for it will be more elegant in appearance  xx about reason how i
t contemplates itself every art and faculty contemplates certain things especially when then it is itself of the same kind with the objects which it contemplates it must of necessity contemplate itself also but when it is of an unlike kind it cannot contemplate itself for instance the shoemakers art is employed on skins but itself is entirely distinct from the material of skins for this reason it does not contemplate itself again the grammarians art is employed about articulate speech is then the art also articulate speech by no means for this reason it is not able to contemplate itself now reason for what purpose has it been given by nature for the right use of appearances what is it then itself a system combination of certain appearances so by its nature it has the faculty of contemplating itself also again sound sensefor the contemplation of what things does it belong to us good and evil and things which are neither what is it then itself good and want of sense what is it evil do you see then that good sen
se necessarily contemplates both itself and the opposite for this reason it is the chief and the first work of a philosopher to examine appearances and to distinguish them and to admit none without examination you see even in the matter of coin in which our interest appears to be somewhat concerned how we have invented an art and how many means the assayer uses to try the value of coin the sight the touch the smell and lastly the hearing he throws the coin denarius down and observes the sound and he is not content with its sounding once but through his great attention he becomes a musician in like manner where we think that to be mistaken and not to be mistaken make a great difference there we apply great attention to discovering the things which can deceive but in the matter of our miserable ruling faculty yawning and sleeping we carelessly admit every appearance for the harm is not noticed  when then you would know how careless you are with respect to good and evil and how active with respect to things whic
h are indifferent neither good nor evil observe how you feel with respect to being deprived of the sight of the eyes and how with respect to being deceived and you will discover that you are far from feeling as you ought to do in relation to good and evil but this is a matter which requires much preparation and much labor and study well then do you expect to acquire the greatest of arts with small labor and yet the chief doctrine of philosophers is very brief if you would know read zenos writings and you will see for how few words it requires to say that mans end or object is to follow the gods and that the nature of good is a proper use of appearances but if you say what is god what is appearance and what is particular and what is universal nature then indeed many words are necessary if then epicurus should come and say that the good must be in the body in this case also many words become necessary and we must be taught what is the leading principle in us and the fundamental and the substantial and as it is 
not probable that the good of a snail is in the shell is it probable that the good of a man is in the body but you yourself epicurus possess something better than this what is that in you which deliberates what is that which examines everything what is that which forms a judgment about the body itself that it is the principal part and why do you light your lamp and labor for us and write so many books is it that we may not be ignorant of the truth who we are and what we are with respect to you thus the discussion requires many words  xxi against those who wish to be admired when a man holds his proper station in life he does not gape after things beyond it man what do you wish to happen to you i am satisfied if i desire and avoid conformably to nature if i employ movements towards and from an object as i am by nature formed to do and purpose and design and assent why then do you strut before us as if you had swallowed a spit my wish has always been that those who meet me should admire me and those who follow 
me should exclaim o the great philosopher  who are they by whom you wish to be admired are they not those of whom you are used to say that they are mad well then do you wish to be admired by madmen  xxii on precognitions precognitions are common to all men and precognition is not contradictory to precognition for who of us does not assume that good is useful and eligible and in all circumstances that we ought to follow and pursue it and who of us does not assume that justice is beautiful and becoming when then does the contradiction arise it arises in the adaptation of the precognitions to the particular cases when one man says he has done well he is a brave man and another says not so but he has acted foolishly then the disputes arise among men this is the dispute among the jews and the syrians and the egyptians and the romans not whether holiness should be preferred to all things and in all cases should be pursued but whether it is holy to eat pigs flesh or not holy you will find this dispute also between a
gamemnon and achilles for call them forth what do you say agamemnon ought not that to be done which is proper and right certainly well what do you say achilles do you not admit that what is good ought to be done i do most certainly adapt your precognitions then to the present matter here the dispute begins agamemnon says i ought not to give up chryseis to her father achilles says you ought it is certain that one of the two makes a wrong adaptation of the precognition of ought or duty further agamemnon says then if i ought to restore chryseis it is fit that i take his prize from some of you achilles replies would you then take her whom i love yes her whom you love must i then be the only man who goes without a prize and must i be the only man who has no prize thus the dispute begins  what then is education education is the learning how to adapt the natural precognitions to the particular things conformably to nature and then to distinguish that of things some are in our power but others are not in our power ar
e will and all acts which depend on the will things not in our power are the body the parts of the body possessions parents brothers children country and generally all with whom we live in society in what then should we place the good to what kind of things οὐσίᾳ shall we adapt it to the things which are in our power is not health then a good thing and soundness of limb and life and are not children and parents and country who will tolerate you if you deny this  let us then transfer the notion of good to these things is it possible then when a man sustains damage and does not obtain good things that he can be happy it is not possible and can he maintain towards society a proper behavior he cannot for i am naturally formed to look after my own interest if it is my interest to have an estate in land it is my interest also to take it from my neighbour if it is my interest to have a garment it is my interest also to steal it from the bath this is the origin of wars civil commotions tyrannies conspiracies and how 
shall i be still able to maintain my duty towards zeus for if i sustain damage and am unlucky he takes no care of me and what is he to me if he cannot help me and further what is he to me if he allows me to be in the condition in which i am i now begin to hate him why then do we build temples why set up statues to zeus as well as to evil demons such as to fever and how is zeus the saviour and how the giver of rain and the giver of fruits and in truth if we place the nature of good in any such things all this follows  what should we do then this is the inquiry of the true philosopher who is in labor now i do not see what the good is nor the bad am i not mad yes but suppose that i place the good somewhere among the things which depend on the will all will laugh at me there will come some greyhead wearing many gold rings on his fingers and he will shake his head and say hear my child it is right that you should philosophize but you ought to have some brains also all this that you are doing is silly you learn the
 syllogism from philosophers but you know how to act better than philosophers doman why then do you blame me if i know what shall i say to this slave if i am silent he will burst i must speak in this way excuse me as you would excuse lovers i am not my own master i am mad  xxiii against epicurus even epicurus perceives that we are by nature social but having once placed our good in the husk he is no longer able to say anything else for on the other hand he strongly maintains this that we ought not to admire nor to accept anything which is detached from the nature of good and he is right in maintaining this how then are we suspicious if we have no natural affection to our children why do you advise the wise man not to bring up children why are you afraid that he may thus fall into trouble for does he fall into trouble on account of the mouse which is nurtured in the house what does he care if a little mouse in the house makes lamentation to him but epicurus knows that if once a child is born it is no longer in
 our power not to love it nor care about it for this reason epicurus says that a man who has any sense also does not engage in political matters for he knows what a man must do who is engaged in such things for indeed if you intend to behave among men as you would among a swarm of flies what hinders you but epicurus who knows this ventures to say that we should not bring up children but a sheep does not desert its own offspring nor yet a wolf and shall a man desert his child what do you mean that we should be as silly as sheep but not even do they desert their offspring or as savage as wolves but not even do wolves desert their young well who would follow your advice if he saw his child weeping after falling on the ground for my part i think that even if your mother and your father had been told by an oracle that you would say what you have said they would not have cast you away  xxiv how we should struggle with circumstances it is circumstances difficulties which show what men are therefore when a difficulty
 falls upon you remember that god like a trainer of wrestlers has matched you with a rough young man for what purpose you may say why that you may become an olympic conqueror but it is not accomplished without sweat in my opinion no man has had a more profitable difficulty than you have had if you choose to make use of it as an athlete would deal with a young antagonist we are now sending a scout to rome but no man sends a cowardly scout who if he only hears a noise and sees a shadow anywhere comes running back in terror and reports that the enemy is close at hand so now if you should come and tell us fearful is the state of affairs at rome terrible is death terrible is exile terrible is calumny terrible is poverty fly my friends the enemy is near we shall answer be gone prophesy for yourself we have committed only one fault that we sent such a scout  diogenes who was sent as a scout before you made a different report to us he says that death is no evil for neither is it base he says that fame reputation is t
he noise of madmen and what has this spy said about pain about pleasure and about poverty he says that to be naked is better than any purple robe and to sleep on the bare ground is the softest bed and he gives as a proof of each thing that he affirms his own courage his tranquillity his freedom and the healthy appearance and compactness of his body there is no enemy near he says all is peace how so diogenes see he replies if i am struck if i have been wounded if i have fled from any man this is what a scout ought to be but you come to us and tell us one thing after another will you not go back and you will see clearer when you have laid aside fear  what then shall i do what do you do when you leave a ship do you take away the helm or the oars what then do you take away you take what is your own your bottle and your wallet and now if you think of what is your own you will never claim what belongs to others the emperor domitian says lay aside your laticlave see i put on the angusticlave lay aside this also see 
i have only my toga lay aside your toga see i am now naked but you still raise my envy take then all my poor body when at a mans command i can throw away my poor body do i still fear him  but a certain person will not leave to me the succession to his estate what then had i forgotten that not one of these things was mine how then do we call them mine just as we call the bed in the inn if then the innkeeper at his death leaves you the beds all well but if he leaves them to another he will have them and you will seek another bed if then you shall not find one you will sleep on the ground only sleep with a good will and snore and remember that tragedies have their place among the rich and kings and tyrants but no poor man fills a part in a tragedy except as one of the chorus kings indeed commence with prosperity ornament the palace with garlands then about the third or fourth act they call out oh cithaeron why didst thou receive me slave where are the crowns where the diadem the guards help thee not at all when 
then you approach any of these persons remember this that you are approaching a tragedian not the actor but oedipus himself but you say such a man is happy for he walks about with many and i also place myself with the many and walk about with many in sum remember this the door is open be not more timid than little children but as they say when the thing does not please them i will play no longer so do you when things seem to you of such a kind say i will no longer play and be gone but if you stay do not complain  xxv on the same if these things are true and if we are not silly and are not acting hypocritically when we say that the good of man is in the will and the evil too and that everything else does not concern us why are we still disturbed why are we still afraid the things about which we have been busied are in no mans power and the things which are in the power of others we care not for what kind of trouble have we still  but give me directions why should i give you directions has not zeus given you di
rections has he not given to you what is your own free from hindrance and free from impediment and what is not your own subject to hindrance and impediment what directions then what kind of orders did you bring when you came from him keep by every means what is your own do not desire what belongs to others fidelity integrity is your own virtuous shame is your own who then can take these things from you who else than yourself will hinder you from using them but how do you act when you seek what is not your own you lose that which is your own having such promptings and commands from zeus what kind do you still ask from me am i more powerful than he am i more worthy of confidence but if you observe these do you want any others besides well but he has not given these orders you will say produce your precognitions προλήψεις produce the proofs of philosophers produce what you have often heard and produce what you have said yourself produce what you have read produce what you have meditated on and you will then see 
that all these things are from god how long then is it fit to observe these precepts from god and not to break up the play as long as the play is continued with propriety in the saturnalia a king is chosen by lot for it has been the custom to play at this game the king commands do you drink do you mix the wine do you sing do you go do you come i obey that the game may not be broken up through mebut if he says think that you are in evil plight i answer i do not think so and who will compel me to think so further we agreed to play agamemnon and achilles he who is appointed to play agamemnon says to me go to achilles and tear from him briseis i go he says come and i come  for as we behave in the matter of hypothetical arguments so ought we to do in life suppose it to be night i suppose that it is night well then is it day no for i admitted the hypothesis that it was night suppose that you think that it is night suppose that i do but also think that it is night that is not consistent with the hypothesis so in thi
s case also suppose that you are unfortunate well suppose so are you then unhappy yes well then are you troubled with an unfavorable daemon fortune yes but think also that you are in misery this is not consistent with the hypothesis and another zeus forbids me to think so  how long then must we obey such orders as long as it is profitable and this means as long as i maintain that which is becoming and consistent further some men are sour and of bad temper and they say i cannot sup with this man to be obliged to hear him telling daily how he fought in mysia i told you brother how i ascended the hill then i began to be besieged again but another says i prefer to get my supper and to hear him talk as much as he likes and do you compare these estimates judgments only do nothing in a depressed mood nor as one afflicted nor as thinking that you are in misery for no man compels you to thathas it smoked in the chamber if the smoke is moderate i will stay if it is excessive i go out for you must always remember this a
nd hold it fast that the door is openwell but you say to me do not live in nicopolis i will not live there nor in athens i will not live in athens nor in rome i will not live in rome live in gyarus i will live in gyarus but it seems like a great smoke to live in gyarus and i depart to the place where no man will hinder me from living for that dwelling place is open to all and as to the last garment that is the poor body no one has any power over me beyond this this was the reason why demetrius said to nero you threaten me with death but nature threatens you if i set my admiration on the poor body i have given myself up to be a slave if on my little possessions i also make myself a slave for i immediately make it plain with what i may be caught as if the snake draws in his head i tell you to strike that part of him which he guards and do you be assured that whatever part you choose to guard that part your master will attack remembering this whom will you still flatter or fear  but i should like to sit where th
e senators sit do you see that you are putting yourself in straits you are squeezing yourself how then shall i see well in any other way in the amphitheatre man do not be a spectator at all and you will not be squeezed why do you give yourself trouble or wait a little and when the spectacle is over seat yourself in the place reserved for the senators and sun yourself for remember this general truth that it is we who squeeze ourselves who put ourselves in straits that is our opinions squeeze us and put us in straits for what is it to be reviled stand by a stone and revile it and what will you gain if then a man listens like a stone what profit is there to the reviler but if the reviler has as a steppingstone or ladder the weakness of him who is reviled then he accomplishes somethingstrip himwhat do you mean by himlay hold of his garment strip it off i have insulted you much good may it do you  this was the practice of socrates this was the reason why he always had one face but we choose to practice and study a
nything rather than the means by which we shall be unimpeded and free you say philosophers talk paradoxes but are there no paradoxes in the other arts and what is more paradoxical than to puncture a mans eye in order that he may see if anyone said this to a man ignorant of the surgical art would he not ridicule the speaker where is the wonder then if in philosophy also many things which are true appear paradoxical to the inexperienced  xxvi what is the law of life when a person was reading hypothetical arguments epictetus said this also is a hypothetical law that we must accept what follows from the hypothesis but much before this law is the law of life that we must act conformably to nature for if in every matter and circumstance we wish to observe what is natural it is plain that in everything we ought to make it our aim that neither that which is consequent shall escape us and that we do not admit the contradictory first then philosophers exercise us in theory contemplation of things which is easier and th
en next they lead us to the more difficult things for in theory there is nothing which draws us away from following what is taught but in the matters of life many are the things which distract us he is ridiculous then who says that he wishes to begin with the matters of real life for it is not easy to begin with the more difficult things and we ought to employ this fact as an argument to those parents who are vexed at their children learning philosophy am i doing wrong then my father and do i not know what is suitable to me and becoming if indeed this can neither be learned nor taught why do you blame me but if it can be taught teach me and if you cannot allow me to learn from those who say that they know how to teach for what do you think do you suppose that i voluntarily fall into evil and miss the good i hope that it may not be so what is then the cause of my doing wrong ignorance do you not choose then that i should get rid of my ignorance who was ever taught by anger the art of a pilot or music do you th
ink then that by means of your anger i shall learn the art of life he only is allowed to speak in this way who has shown such an intention but if a man only intending to make a display at a banquet and to show that he is acquainted with hypothetical arguments reads them and attends the philosophers what other object has he than that some man of senatorian rank who sits by him may admire for there at rome are the really great materials opportunities and the riches here at nicopolis appear to be trifles there this is the reason why it is difficult for a man to be master of the appearances where the things which disturb the judgment are great i know a certain person who complained as he embraced the knees of epaphroditus that he had only one hundred and fifty times ten thousand denarii remaining what then did epaphroditus do did he laugh at him as we slaves of epaphroditus did no but he cried out with amazement poor man how then did you keep silence how did you endure it  when epictetus had reproved called the p
erson who was reading the hypothetical arguments and the teacher who had suggested the reading was laughing at the reader epictetus said to the teacher you are laughing at yourself you did not prepare the young man nor did you ascertain whether he was able to understand these matters but perhaps you are only employing him as a reader well then said epictetus if a man has not ability enough to understand a complex syllogism do we trust him in giving praise do we trust him in giving blame do we allow that he is able to form a judgment about good or bad and if such a man blames anyone does the man care for the blame and if he praises anyone is the man elated when in such small matters as a hypothetical syllogism he who praises cannot see what is consequent on the hypothesis  this then is the beginning of philosophy a mans perception of the state of his ruling faculty for when a man knows that it is weak then he will not employ it on things of the greatest difficulty but at present if men cannot swallow even a mo
rsel they buy whole volumes and attempt to devour them and this is the reason why they vomit them up or suffer indigestion and then come gripings defluxes and fevers such men ought to consider what their ability is in theory it is easy to convince an ignorant person but in the affairs of real life no one offers himself to be convinced and we hate the man who has convinced us but socrates advised us not to live a life which is not subjected to examination  xxvii in how many ways appearances exist and what aids we should provide against them appearances are to us in four ways for either things appear as they are or they are not and do not even appear to be or they are and do not appear to be or they are not and yet appear to be further in all these cases to form a right judgment to hit the mark is the office of an educated man but whatever it is that annoys troubles us to that we ought to apply a remedy if the sophisms of pyrrho and of the academics are what annoys troubles we must apply the remedy to them if i
t is the persuasion of appearances by which some things appear to be good when they are not good let us seek a remedy for this if it is habit which annoys us we must try to seek aid against habit what aid then can we find against habit the contrary habit you hear the ignorant say that unfortunate person is dead his father and mother are overpowered with sorrow he was cut off by an untimely death and in a foreign land hear the contrary way of speaking tear yourself from these expressions oppose to one habit the contrary habit to sophistry oppose reason and the exercise and discipline of reason against persuasive deceitful appearances we ought to have manifest precognitions προλήψεις cleared of all impurities and ready to hand  when death appears an evil we ought to have this rule in readiness that it is fit to avoid evil things and that death is a necessary thing for what shall i do and where shall i escape it suppose that i am not sarpedon the son of zeus nor able to speak in this noble way i will go and i am
 resolved either to behave bravely myself or to give to another the opportunity of doing so if i cannot succeed in doing anything myself i will not grudge another the doing of something noblesuppose that it is above our power to act thus is it not in our power to reason thus tell me where i can escape death discover for me the country show me the men to whom i must go whom death does not visit discover to me a charm against death if i have not one what do you wish me to do i cannot escape from death shall i not escape from the fear of death but shall i die lamenting and trembling for the origin of perturbation is this to wish for something and that this should not happen therefore if i am able to change externals according to my wish i change them but if i cannot i am ready to tear out the eyes of him who hinders me for the nature of man is not to endure to be deprived of the good and not to endure the falling into the evil then at last when i am neither able to change circumstances nor to tear out the eyes o
f him who hinders me i sit down and groan and abuse whom i can zeus and the rest of the gods for if they do not care for me what are they to meyes but you will be an impious manin what respect then will it be worse for me than it is nowto sum up remember this that unless piety and your interest be in the same thing piety cannot be maintained in any man do not these things seem necessary true  let the followers of pyrrho and the academics come and make their objections for i as to my part have no leisure for these disputes nor am i able to undertake the defense of common consent opinion if i had a suit even about a bit of land i would call in another to defend my interests with what evidence then am i satisfied with that which belongs to the matter in hand how indeed perception is effected whether through the whole body or any part perhaps i cannot explain for both opinions perplex me but that you and i are not the same i know with perfect certainty how do you know it when i intend to swallow anything i never 
carry it to your mouth but to my own when i intend to take bread i never lay hold of a broom but i always go to the bread as to a mark and you yourselves the pyrrhonists who take away the evidence of the senses do you act otherwise who among you when he intended to enter a bath ever went into a mill  what then ought we not with all our power to hold to this also the maintaining of general opinion and fortifying ourselves against the arguments which are directed against it who denies that we ought to do this well he should do it who is able who has leisure for it but as to him who trembles and is perturbed and is inwardly broken in heart spirit he must employ his time better on something else  xxviii that we ought not to be angry with men and what are the small and the great things among men what is the cause of assenting to anything the fact that it appears to be true it is not possible then to assent to that which appears not to be true why because this is the nature of the understanding to incline to the tr
ue to be dissatisfied with the false and in matters uncertain to withhold assent what is the proof of this imagine persuade yourself if you can that it is now night it is not possible take away your persuasion that it is day it is not possible persuade yourself or take away your persuasion that the stars are even in number it is impossible when then any man assents to that which is false be assured that he did not intend to assent to it as false for every soul is unwillingly deprived of the truth as plato says but the falsity seemed to him to be true well in acts what have we of the like kind as we have here truth or falsehood we have the fit and the not fit duty and not duty the profitable and the unprofitable that which is suitable to a person and that which is not and whatever is like these can then a man think that a thing is useful to him and not choose it he cannot how says medea  tis true i know what evil i shall do but passion overpowers the better counsel she thought that to indulge her passion and t
ake vengeance on her husband was more profitable than to spare her children it was so but she was deceived show her plainly that she is deceived and she will not do it but so long as you do not show it what can she follow except that which appears to herself her opinion nothing else why then are you angry with the unhappy woman that she has been bewildered about the most important things and is become a viper instead of a human creature and why not if it is possible rather pity as we pity the blind and the lame so those who are blinded and maimed in the faculties which are supreme  whoever then clearly remembers this that to man the measure of every act is the appearance the opinionwhether the thing appears good or bad if good he is free from blame if bad himself suffers the penalty for it is impossible that he who is deceived can be one person and he who suffers another personwhoever remembers this will not be angry with any man will not be vexed at any man will not revile or blame any man nor hate nor quarr
el with any man  so then all these great and dreadful deeds have this origin in the appearance opinion yes this origin and no other the iliad is nothing else than appearance and the use of appearances it appeared to alexander to carry off the wife of menelaus it appeared to helene to follow him if then it had appeared to menelaus to feel that it was a gain to be deprived of such a wife what would have happened not only would the iliad have been lost but the odyssey also on so small a matter then did such great things depend but what do you mean by such great things wars and civil commotions and the destruction of many men and cities and what great matter is this is it nothingbut what great matter is the death of many oxen and many sheep and many nests of swallows or storks being burnt or destroyed are these things then like those very like bodies of men are destroyed and the bodies of oxen and sheep the dwellings of men are burnt and the nests of storks what is there in this great or dreadful or show me what 
is the difference between a mans house and a storks nest as far as each is a dwelling except that man builds his little houses of beams and tiles and bricks and the stork builds them of sticks and mud are a stork and a man then like things what say youin body they are very much alike  does a man then differ in no respect from a stork dont suppose that i say so but there is no difference in these matters which i have mentioned in what then is the difference seek and you will find that there is a difference in another matter see whether it is not in a man the understanding of what he does see if it is not in social community in fidelity in modesty in steadfastness in intelligence where then is the great good and evil in men it is where the difference is if the difference is preserved and remains fenced round and neither modesty is destroyed nor fidelity nor intelligence then the man also is preserved but if any of these things is destroyed and stormed like a city then the man too perishes and in this consist th
e great things alexander you say sustained great damage then when the hellenes invaded and when they ravaged troy and when his brothers perished by no means for no man is damaged by an action which is not his own but what happened at that time was only the destruction of storks nests now the ruin of alexander was when he lost the character of modesty fidelity regard to hospitality and to decency when was achilles ruined was it when patroclus died not so but it happened when he began to be angry when he wept for a girl when he forgot that he was at troy not to get mistresses but to fight these things are the ruin of men this is being besieged this is the destruction of cities when right opinions are destroyed when they are corrupted  when then women are carried off when children are made captives and when the men are killed are these not evils how is it then that you add to the facts these opinions explain this to me alsoi shall not do that but how is it that you say that these are not evilslet us come to the 
rules produce the precognitions προλήψεις for it is because this is neglected that we cannot sufficiently wonder at what men do when we intend to judge of weights we do not judge by guess where we intend to judge of straight and crooked we do not judge by guess in all cases where it is our interest to know what is true in any matter never will any man among us do anything by guess but in things which depend on the first and on the only cause of doing right or wrong of happiness or unhappiness of being unfortunate or fortunate there only we are inconsiderate and rash there is then nothing like scales balance nothing like a rule but some appearance is presented and straightway i act according to it must i then suppose that i am superior to achilles or agamemnon so that they by following appearances do and suffer so many evils and shall not the appearance be sufficient for meand what tragedy has any other beginning the atreus of euripides what is it an appearance the oedipus of sophocles what is it an appearance
 the phoenix an appearance the hippolytus an appearance what kind of a man then do you suppose him to be who pays no regard to this matter and what is the name of those who follow every appearance they are called madmen do we then act at all differently  xxix on constancy or firmness the being nature of the good is a certain will the being of the bad is a certain kind of will what then are externals materials for the will about which the will being conversant shall obtain its own good or evil how shall it obtain the good if it does not admire overvalue the materials for the opinions about the materials if the opinions are right make the will good but perverse and distorted opinions make the will bad god has fixed this law and says if you would have anything good receive it from yourself you say no but i will have it from another do not so but receive it from yourself therefore when the tyrant threatens and calls me i say whom do you threaten if he says i will put you in chains i say you threaten my hands and 
my feet if he says i will cut off your head i reply you threaten my head if he says i will throw you into prison i say you threaten the whole of this poor body if he threatens me with banishment i say the same does he then not threaten you at all if i feel that all these things do not concern me he does not threaten me at all but if i fear any of them it is i whom he threatens whom then do i fear the master of what the master of things which are in my own power there is no such master do i fear the master of things which are not in my power and what are these things to me  do you philosophers then teach us to despise kings i hope not who among us teaches to claim against them the power over things which they possess take my poor body take my property take my reputation take those who are about me if i advise any persons to claim these things they may truly accuse me yes but i intend to command your opinions also and who has given you this power how can you conquer the opinion of another man by applying terror
 to it he replies i will conquer it do you not know that opinion conquers itself and is not conquered by another but nothing else can conquer will except the will itself for this reason too the law of god is most powerful and most just which is this let the stronger always be superior to the weaker ten are stronger than one for what for putting in chains for killing for dragging whither they choose for taking away what a man has the ten therefore conquer the one in this in which they are stronger in what then are the ten weaker if the one possesses right opinions and the others do not well then can the ten conquer in this matter how is it possible if we were placed in the scales must not the heavier draw down the scale in which it is  how strange then that socrates should have been so treated by the athenians slave why do you say socrates speak of the thing as it is how strange that the poor body of socrates should have been carried off and dragged to prison by stronger men and that anyone should have given h
emlock to the poor body of socrates and that it should breathe out the life do these things seem strange do they seem unjust do you on account of these things blame god had socrates then no equivalent for these things where then for him was the nature of good whom shall we listen to you or him and what does socrates say anytus and melitus can kill me but they cannot hurt me and further he says if it so pleases god so let it be  but show me that he who has the inferior principles overpowers him who is superior in principles you will never show this nor come near showing it for this is the law of nature and of god that the superior shall always overpower the inferior in what in that in which it is superior one body is stronger than another many are stronger than one the thief is stronger than he who is not a thief this is the reason why i also lost my lamp because in wakefulness the thief was superior to me but the man bought the lamp at this price for a lamp he became a thief a faithless fellow and like a wild
 beast this seemed to him a good bargain be it so but a man has seized me by the cloak and is drawing me to the public place then others bawl out philosopher what has been the use of your opinions see you are dragged to prison you are going to be beheaded and what system of philosophy εἰσαγωγήν could i have made so that if a stronger man should have laid hold of my cloak i should not be dragged off that if ten men should have laid hold of me and cast me into prison i should not be cast in have i learned nothing else then i have learned to see that everything which happens if it be independent of my will is nothing to me i may ask if you have not gained by this why then do you seek advantage in anything else than in that in which you have learned that advantage is  then sitting in prison i say the man who cries out in this way neither hears what words mean nor understands what is said nor does he care at all to know what philosophers say or what they do let him alone  but now he says to the prisoner come out f
rom your prisonif you have no further need of me in prison i come out if you should have need of me again i will enter the prisonhow long will you act thusso long as reason requires me to be with the body but when reason does not require this take away the body and fare you well only we must not do it inconsiderately nor weakly nor for any slight reason for on the other hand god does not wish it to be done and he has need of such a world and such inhabitants in it but if he sounds the signal for retreat as he did to socrates we must obey him who gives the signal as if he were a general  well then ought we to say such things to the many why should we is it not enough for a man to be persuaded himself when children come clapping their hands and crying out today is the good saturnalia do we say the saturnalia are not good by no means but we clap our hands also do you also then when you are not able to make a man change his mind be assured that he is a child and clap your hands with him and if you do not choose t
o do this keep silent  a man must keep this in mind and when he is called to any such difficulty he should know that the time is come for showing if he has been instructed for he who is come into a difficulty is like a young man from a school who has practiced the resolution of syllogisms and if any person proposes to him an easy syllogism he says rather propose to me a syllogism which is skillfully complicated that i may exercise myself on it even athletes are dissatisfied with slight young men and say he cannot lift methis is a youth of noble disposition you do not so but when the time of trial is come one of you must weep and say i wish that i had learned more a little more of what if you did not learn these things in order to show them in practice why did you learn them i think that there is someone among you who are sitting here who is suffering like a woman in labor and saying oh that such a difficulty does not present itself to me as that which has come to this man oh that i should be wasting my life i
n a corner when i might be crowned at olympia when will anyone announce to me such a contest such ought to be the disposition of all of you even among the gladiators of caesar the emperor there are some who complain grievously that they are not brought forward and matched and they offer up prayers to god and address themselves to their superintendents entreating that they may fight and will no one among you show himself such i would willingly take a voyage to rome for this purpose and see what my athlete is doing how he is studying his subjecti do not choose such a subject he says why is it in your power to take what subject you choose there has been given to you such a body as you have such parents such brethren such a country such a place in your countrythen you come to me and say change my subject have you not abilities which enable you to manage the subject which has been given to you you ought to say it is your business to propose it is mine to exercise myself well however you do not say so but you say d
o not propose to me such a tropic but such as i would choose do not urge against me such an objection but such as i would choose there will be a time perhaps when tragic actors will suppose that they are only masks and buskins and the long cloak i say these things man are your material and subject utter something that we may know whether you are a tragic actor or a buffoon for both of you have all the rest in common if anyone then should take away the tragic actors buskins and his mask and introduce him on the stage as a phantom is the tragic actor lost or does he still remain if he has voice he still remains  an example of another kind assume the governorship of a province i assume it and when i have assumed it i show how an instructed man behaves lay aside the laticlave the mark of senatorial rank and clothing yourself in rags come forward in this character what then have i not the power of displaying a good voice that is of doing something that i ought to do how then do you now appear on the stage of life 
as a witness summoned by god come forward you and bear testimony for me for you are worthy to be brought forward as a witness by me is anything external to the will good or bad do i hurt any man have i made every mans interest dependent on any man except himself what testimony do you give for godi am in a wretched condition master lord and i am unfortunate no man cares for me no man gives me anything all blame me all steak ill of meis this the evidence that you are going to give and disgrace his summons who has conferred so much honor on you and thought you worthy of being called to bear such testimony  but suppose that he who has the power has declared i judge you to be impious and profane what has happened to you i have been judged to be impious and profane nothing else nothing else but if the same person had passed judgment on a hypothetical syllogism συνημμένου and had made a declaration the conclusion that if it is day it is light i declare to be false what has happened to the hypothetical syllogism who 
is judged in this case who has been condemned the hypothetical syllogism or the man who has been deceived by it does he then who has the power of making any declaration about you know what is pious or impious has he studied it and has he learned it where from whom then is it the fact that a musician pays no regard to him who declares that the lowest chord in the lyre is the highest nor yet a geometrician if he declares that the lines from the centre of a circle to the circumference are not equal and shall he who is really instructed pay any regard to the uninstructed man when he pronounces judgment on what is pious and what is impious on what is just and unjust oh the signal wrong done by the instructed did they learn this here  will you not leave the small arguments λογάρια about these matters to others to lazy fellows that they may sit in a corner and receive their sorry pay or grumble that no one gives them anything and will you not come forward and make use of what you have learned for it is not these sma
ll arguments that are wanted now the writings of the stoics are full of them what then is the thing which is wanted a man who shall apply them one who by his acts shall bear testimony to his words assume i entreat you this character that we may no longer use in the schools the examples of the ancients but may have some example of our own  to whom then does the contemplation of these matters philosophical inquiries belong to him who has leisure for man is an animal that loves contemplation but it is shameful to contemplate these things as runaway slaves do we should sit as in a theatre free from distraction and listen at one time to the tragic actor at another time to the luteplayer and not do as slaves do as soon as the slave has taken his station he praises the actor and at the same time looks round then if anyone calls out his masters name the slave is immediately frightened and disturbed it is shameful for philosophers thus to contemplate the works of nature for what is a master man is not the master of ma
n but death is and life and pleasure and pain for if he comes without these things bring caesar to me and you will see how firm i am but when he shall come with these things thundering and lightning and when i am afraid of them what do i do then except to recognize my master like the runaway slave but so long as i have any respite from these terrors as a runaway slave stands in the theatre so do i i bathe i drink i sing but all this i do with terror and uneasiness but if i shall release myself from my masters that is from those things by means of which masters are formidable what further trouble have i what master have i still  what then ought we to publish these things to all men no but we ought to accommodate ourselves to the ignorant τοῖς ἰδιώταις and to say this man recommends to me that which he thinks good for himself i excuse him for socrates also excused the jailor who had the charge of him in prison and was weeping when socrates was going to drink the poison and said how generously he laments over us
 does he then say to the jailor that for this reason we have sent away the women no but he says it to his friends who were able to hear understand it and he treats the jailor as a child  xxx what we ought to have ready in difficult circumstances when you are going in to any great personage remember that another also from above sees what is going on and that you ought to please him rather than the other he then who sees from above asks you in the schools what used you to say about exile and bonds and death and disgrace i used to say that they are things indifferent neither good nor bad what then do you say of them now are they changed at all no are you changed then no tell me then what things are indifferent the things which are independent of the will tell me also what follows from this the things which are independent of the will are nothing to me tell me also about the good what was your opinion a will such as we ought to have and also such a use of appearances and the end purpose what is it to follow thee 
do you say this now also i say the same now also  then go in to the great personage boldly and remember these things and you will see what a youth is who has studied these things when he is among men who have not studied them i indeed imagine that you will have such thoughts as these why do we make so great and so many preparations for nothing is this the thing which men name power is this the antechamber this the men of the bedchamber this the armed guards is it for this that i listened to so many discourses all this is nothing but i have been preparing myself as for something great  book ii i that confidence courage is not inconsistent with caution the opinion of the philosophers perhaps seems to some to be a paradox but still let us examine as well as we can if it is true that it is possible to do everything both with caution and with confidence for caution seems to be in a manner contrary to confidence and contraries are in no way consistent that which seems to many to be a paradox in the matter under con
sideration in my opinion is of this kind if we asserted that we ought to employ caution and confidence in the same things men might justly accuse us of bringing together things which cannot be united but now where is the difficulty in what is said for if these things are true which have been often said and often proved that the nature of good is in the use of appearances and the nature of evil likewise and that things independent of our will do not admit either the nature of evil nor of good what paradox do the philosophers assert if they say that where things are not dependent on the will there you should employ confidence but where they are dependent on the will there you should employ caution for if the bad consists in a bad exercise of the will caution ought only to be used where things are dependent on the will but if things independent of the will and not in our power are nothing to us with respect to these we must employ confidence and thus we shall both be cautious and confident and indeed confident b
ecause of our caution for by employing caution towards things which are really bad it will result that we shall have confidence with respect to things which are not so  we are then in the condition of deer when they flee from the huntsmens feathers in fright whither do they turn and in what do they seek refuge as safe they turn to the nets and thus they perish by confounding things which are objects of fear with things that they ought not to fear thus we also act in what cases do we fear in things which are independent of the will in what cases on the contrary do we behave with confidence as if there were no danger in things dependent on the will to be deceived then or to act rashly or shamelessly or with base desire to seek something does not concern us at all if we only hit the mark in things which are independent of our will but where there is death or exile or pain or infamy there we attempt to run away there we are struck with terror therefore as we may expect it to happen with those who err in the great
est matters we convert natural confidence that is according to nature into audacity desperation rashness shamelessness and we convert natural caution and modesty into cowardice and meanness which are full of fear and confusion for if a man should transfer caution to those things in which the will may be exercised and the acts of the will he will immediately by willing to be cautious have also the power of avoiding what he chooses but if he transfer it to the things which are not in his power and will and attempt to avoid the things which are in the power of others he will of necessity fear he will be unstable he will be disturbed for death or pain is not formidable but the fear of pain or death for this reason we commend the poet who said  not death is evil but a shameful death confidence courage then ought to be employed against death and caution against the fear of death but now we do the contrary and employ against death the attempt to escape and to our opinion about it we employ carelessness rashness and 
indifference these things socrates properly used to call tragic masks for as to children masks appear terrible and fearful from inexperience we also are affected in like manner by events the things which happen in life for no other reason than children are by masks for what is a child ignorance what is a child want of knowledge for when a child knows these things he is in no way inferior to us what is death a tragic mask turn it and examine it see it does not bite the poor body must be separated from the spirit either now or later as it was separated from it before why then are you troubled if it be separated now for if it is not separated now it will be separated afterwards why that the period of the universe may be completed for it has need of the present and of the future and of the past what is pain a mask turn it and examine it the poor flesh is moved roughly then on the contrary smoothly if this does not satisfy please you the door is open if it does bear with things for the door ought to be open for al
l occasions and so we have no trouble  what then is the fruit of these opinions it is that which ought to be the most noble and the most becoming to those who are really educated release from perturbation release from fear freedom for in these matters we must not believe the many who say that free persons only ought to be educated but we should rather believe the philosophers who say that the educated only are free how is this in this manner is freedom anything else than the power of living as we choose nothing else tell me then ye men do you wish to live in error we do not no one then who lives in error is free do you wish to live in fear do you wish to live in sorrow do you wish to live in perturbation by no means no one then who is in a state of fear or sorrow or perturbation is free but whoever is delivered from sorrows and fears and perturbations he is at the same time also delivered from servitude how then can we continue to believe you most dear legislators when you say we only allow free persons to be
 educated for philosophers say we allow none to be free except the educated that is god does not allow it when then a man has turned round before the praetor his own slave has he done nothing he has done something what he has turned round his own slave before the praetor has he done nothing more yes he is also bound to pay for him the tax called the twentieth well then is not the man who has gone through this ceremony become free no more than he is become free from perturbations have you who are able to turn round free others no master is not money your master or a girl or a boy or some tyrant or some friend of the tyrant why do you tremble then when you are going off to any trial danger of this kind it is for this reason that i often say study and hold in readiness these principles by which you may determine what those things are with reference to which you ought to have confidence courage and those things with reference to which you ought to be cautiouscourageous in that which does not depend on your will c
autious in that which does depend on it  well have i not read to you and do you not know what i was doing in what in my little dissertationsshow me how you are with respect to desire and aversion ἔκκλισιν and show me if you do not fail in getting what you wish and if you do not fall into the things which you would avoid but as to these long and labored sentences you will take them and blot them out  what then did not socrates write and who wrote so muchbut how as he could not always have at hand one to argue against his principles or to be argued against in turn he used to argue with and examine himself and he was always treating at least some one subject in a practical way these are the things which a philosopher writes but little dissertations and that method which i speak of he leaves to others to the stupid or to those happy men who being free from perturbations have leisure or to such as are too foolish to reckon consequences  and will you now when the opportunity invites go and display those things whic
h you possess and recite them and make an idle show and say see how i make dialogues do not so my man but rather say see how i am not disappointed of that which i desire see how i do not fall into that which i would avoid set death before me and you will see set before me pain prison disgrace and condemnation this is the proper display of a young man who is come out of the schools but leave the rest to others and let no one ever hear you say a word about these things and if any man commends you for them do not allow it but think that you are nobody and know nothing only show that you know this how never to be disappointed in your desire and how never to fall into that which you would avoid let others labor at forensic causes problems and syllogisms do you labor at thinking about death chains the rack exile and do all this with confidence and reliance on him who has called you to these sufferings who has judged you worthy of the place in which being stationed you will show what things the rational governing po
wer can do when it takes its stand against the forces which are not within the power of our will and thus this paradox will no longer appear either impossible or a paradox that a man ought to be at the same time cautious and courageouscourageous towards the things which do not depend on the will and cautious in things which are within the power of the will  ii of tranquillity freedom from perturbation consider you who are going into court what you wish to maintain and what you wish to succeed in for if you wish to maintain a will conformable to nature you have every security every facility you have no troubles for if you wish to maintain what is in your own power and is naturally free and if you are content with these what else do you care for for who is the master of such things who can take them away if you choose to be modest and faithful who shall not allow you to be so if you choose not to be restrained or compelled who shall compel you to desire what you think that you ought not to desire who shall comp
el you to avoid what you do not think fit to avoid but what do you say the judge will determine against you something that appears formidable but that you should also suffer in trying to avoid it how can he do that when then the pursuit of objects and the avoiding of them are in your power what else do you care for let this be your preface this your narrative this your confirmation this your victory this your peroration this your applause or the approbation which you will receive  therefore socrates said to one who was reminding him to prepare for his trial do you not think then that i have been preparing for it all my life by what kind of preparation i have maintained that which was in my own power how then i have never done anything unjust either in my private or in my public life  but if you wish to maintain externals alsoyour poor body your little property and your little estimationi advise you to make from this moment all possible preparation and then consider both the nature of your judge and your adver
sary if it is necessary to embrace his knees embrace his knees if to weep weep if to groan groan for when you have subjected to externals what is your own then be a slave and do not resist and do not sometimes choose to be a slave and sometimes not choose but with all your mind be one or the other either free or a slave either instructed or uninstructed either a well bred cock or a mean one either endure to be beaten until you die or yield at once and let it not happen to you to receive many stripes and then to yield but if these things are base determine immediately where is the nature of evil and good it is where truth is where truth is and where nature is there is caution where truth is there is courage where nature is  for what do you think do you think that if socrates had wished to preserve externals he would have come forward and said anytus and melitus can certainly kill me but to harm me they are not able was he so foolish as not to see that this way leads not to the preservation of life and fortune 
but to another end what is the reason then that he takes no account of his adversaries and even irritates them just in the same way my friend heraclitus who had a little suit in rhodes about a bit of land and had proved to the judges δικασταῖς that his case was just said when he had come to the peroration of his speech i will neither entreat you nor do i care what judgment you will give and it is you rather than i who are on your trial and thus he ended the business what need was there of this only do not entreat but do not also say i do not entreat unless there is a fit occasion to irritate purposely the judges as was the case with socrates and you if you are preparing such a peroration why do you wait why do you obey the order to submit to trial for if you wish to be crucified wait and the cross will come but if you choose to submit and to plead your cause as well as you can you must do what is consistent with this object provided you maintain what is your own your proper character  for this reason also it 
is ridiculous to say suggest something to me tell me what to do what should i suggest to you well form my mind so as to accommodate itself to any event why that is just the same as if a man who is ignorant of letters should say tell me what to write when any name is proposed to me for if i should tell him to write dion and then another should come and propose to him not the name of dion but that of theon what will be done what will he write but if you have practiced writing you are also prepared to write or to do anything that is required if you are not what can i now suggest for if circumstances require something else what will you say or what will you do remember then this general precept and you will need no suggestion but if you gape after externals you must of necessity ramble up and down in obedience to the will of your master and who is the master he who has the power over the things which you seek to gain or try to avoid  iii to those who recommend persons to philosophers diogenes said well to one who
 asked from him letters of recommendation that you are a man he said he will know as soon as he sees you and he will know whether you are good or bad if he is by experience skillful to distinguish the good and the bad but if he is without experience he will never know if i write to him ten thousand times for it is just the same as if a drachma a piece of silver money asked to be recommended to a person to be tested if he is skillful in testing silver he will know what you are for you the drachma will recommend yourself we ought then in life also to have some skill as in the case of silver coin that a man may be able to say like the judge of silver bring me any drachma and i will test it but in the case of syllogisms i would say bring any man that you please and i will distinguish for you the man who knows how to resolve syllogisms and the man who does not why because i know how to resolve syllogisms i have the power which a man must have who is able to discover those who have the power of resolving syllogisms
 but in life how do i act at one time i call a thing good and at another time bad what is the reason the contrary to that which is in the case of syllogisms ignorance and inexperience  iv against a person who had once been detected in adultery as epictetus was saying that man is formed for fidelity and that he who subverts fidelity subverts the peculiar characteristic of men there entered one of those who are considered to be men of letters who had once been detected in adultery in the city then epictetus continued but if we lay aside this fidelity for which we are formed and make designs against our neighbours wife what are we doing what else but destroying and overthrowing whom the man of fidelity the man of modesty the man of sanctity is this all and are we not overthrowing neighbourhood and friendship and the community and in what place are we putting ourselves how shall i consider you man as a neighbour as a friend what kind of one as a citizen wherein shall i trust you so if you were an utensil so worth
less that a man could not use you you would be pitched out on the dung heaps and no man would pick you up but if being a man you are unable to fill any place which befits a man what shall we do with you for suppose that you cannot hold the place of a friend can you hold the place of a slave and who will trust you are you not then content that you also should be pitched somewhere on a dung heap as a useless utensil and a bit of dung then will you say no man cares for me a man of letters they do not because you are bad and useless it is just as if the wasps complained because no man cares for them but all fly from them and if a man can he strikes them and knocks them down you have such a sting that you throw into trouble and pain any man that you wound with it what would you have us do with you you have no place where you can be put  what then are not women common by nature so i say also for a little pig is common to all the invited guests but when the portions have been distributed go if you think it right and
 snatch up the portion of him who reclines next to you or slyly steal it or place your hand down by it and lay hold of it and if you cannot tear away a bit of the meat grease your fingers and lick them a fine companion over cups and socratic guest indeed well is not the theatre common to the citizens when then they have taken their seats come if you think proper and eject one of them in this way women also are common by nature when then the legislator like the master of a feast has distributed them will you not also look for your own portion and not filch and handle what belongs to another but i am a man of letters and understand archedemus understand archedemus then and be an adulterer and faithless and instead of a man be a wolf or an ape for what is the difference  v how magnanimity is consistent with care things themselves materials are indifferent but the use of them is not indifferent how then shall a man preserve firmness and tranquillity and at the same time be careful and neither rash nor negligent i
f he imitates those who play at dice the counters are indifferent the dice are indifferent how do i know what the cast will be but to use carefully and dexterously the cast of the dice this is my business thus then in life also the chief business is this distinguish and separate things and say externals are not in my power will is in my power where shall i seek the good and the bad within in the things which are my own but in what does not belong to you call nothing either good or bad or profit or damage or anything of the kind  what then should we use such things carelessly in no way for this on the other hand is bad for the faculty of the will and consequently against nature but we should act carefully because the use is not indifferent and we should also act with firmness and freedom from perturbations because the material is indifferent for where the material is not indifferent there no man can hinder me nor compel me where i can be hindered and compelled the obtaining of those things is not in my power n
or is it good or bad but the use is either bad or good and the use is in my power but it is difficult to mingle and to bring together these two things the carefulness of him who is affected by the matter or things about him and the firmness of him who has no regard for it but it is not impossible and if it is happiness is impossible but we should act as we do in the case of a voyage what can i do i can choose the master of the ship the sailors the day the opportunity then comes a storm what more have i to care for for my part is done the business belongs to another the masterbut the ship is sinkingwhat then have i to do i do the only thing that i can not to be drowned full of fear nor screaming nor blaming god but knowing that what has been produced must also perish for i am not an immortal being but a man a part of the whole as an hour is a part of the day i must be present like the hour and past like the hour what difference then does it make to me how i pass away whether by being suffocated or by a fever f
or i must pass through some such means  this is just what you will see those doing who play at ball skillfully no one cares about the ball as being good or bad but about throwing and catching it in this therefore is the skill in this the art the quickness the judgment so that even if i spread out my lap i may not be able to catch it and another if i throw may catch the ball but if with perturbation and fear we receive or throw the ball what kind of play is it then and wherein shall a man be steady and how shall a man see the order in the game but one will say throw or do not throw and another will say you have thrown once this is quarrelling not play  socrates then knew how to play at ball how by using pleasantry in the court where he was tried tell me he says anytus how do you say that i do not believe in god the daemons δαίμονες who are they think you are they not sons of gods or compounded of gods and men when anytus admitted this socrates said who then think you can believe that there are mules half asses
 but not asses and this he said as if he were playing at ball and what was the ball in that case life chains banishment a draught of poison separation from wife and leaving children orphans these were the things with which he was playing but still he did play and threw the ball skillfully so we should do we must employ all the care of the players but show the same indifference about the ball for we ought by all means to apply our art to some external material not as valuing the material but whatever it may be showing our art in it thus too the weaver does not make wool but exercises his art upon such as he receives another gives you food and property and is able to take them away and your poor body also when then you have received the material work on it if then you come out of the trial without having suffered anything all who meet you will congratulate you on your escape but he who knows how to look at such things if he shall see that you have behaved properly in the matter will commend you and be pleased w
ith you and if he shall find that you owe your escape to any want of proper behavior he will do the contrary for where rejoicing is reasonable there also is congratulation reasonable  how then is it said that some external things are according to nature and others contrary to nature it is said as it might be said if we were separated from union or society for to the foot i shall say that it is according to nature for it to be clean but if you take it as a foot and as a thing not detached independent it will befit it both to step into the mud and tread on thorns and sometimes to be cut off for the good of the whole body otherwise it is no longer a foot we should think in some such way about ourselves also what are you a man if you consider yourself as detached from other men it is according to nature to live to old age to be rich to be healthy but if you consider yourself as a man and a part of a certain whole it is for the sake of that whole that at one time you should be sick at another time take a voyage an
d run into danger and at another time be in want and in some cases die prematurely why then are you troubled do you not know that as a foot is no longer a foot if it is detached from the body so you are no longer a man if you are separated from other men for what is a man a part of a state of that first which consists of gods and of men then of that which is called next to it which is a small image of the universal state what then must i be brought to trial must another have a fever another sail on the sea another die and another be condemned yes for it is impossible in such a body in such a universe of things among so many living together that such things should not happen some to one and others to others it is your duty then since you are come here to say what you ought to arrange these things as it is fit then someone says i shall charge you with doing me wrong much good may it do you i have done my part but whether you also have done yours you must look to that for there is some danger of this too that it
 may escape your notice  vi of indifference the hypothetical proposition is indifferent the judgment about it is not indifferent but it is either knowledge or opinion or error thus life is indifferent the use is not indifferent when any man then tells you that these things also are indifferent do not become negligent and when a man invites you to be careful about such things do not become abject and struck with admiration of material things and it is good for you to know your own preparation and power that in those matters where you have not been prepared you may keep quiet and not be vexed if others have the advantage over you for you too in syllogisms will claim to have the advantage over them and if others should be vexed at this you will console them by saying i have learned them and you have not thus also where there is need of any practice seek not that which is acquired from the need of such practice but yield in that matter to those who have had practice and be yourself content with firmness of mind  
go and salute a certain person how not meanly but i have been shut out for i have not learned to make my way through the window and when i have found the door shut i must either come back or enter through the window but still speak to him in what way not meanly but suppose that you have not got what you wanted was this your business and not his why then do you claim that which belongs to another always remember what is your own and what belongs to another and you will not be disturbed chrysippus therefore said well so long as future things are uncertain i always cling to those which are more adapted to the conservation of that which is according to nature for god himself has given me the faculty of such choice but if i knew that it was fated in the order of things for me to be sick i would even move towards it for the foot also if it had intelligence would move to go into the mud for why are ears of corn produced is it not that they may become dry and do they not become dry that they may be reaped for they ar
e not separated from communion with other things if then they had perception ought they to wish never to be reaped but this is a curse upon ears of corn to be never reaped so we must know that in the case of men too it is a curse not to die just the same as not to be ripened and not to be reaped but since we must be reaped and we also know that we are reaped we are vexed at it for we neither know what we are nor have we studied what belongs to man as those who have studied horses know what belongs to horses but chrysantas when he was going to strike the enemy checked himself when he heard the trumpet sounding a retreat so it seemed better to him to obey the generals command than to follow his own inclination but not one of us chooses even when necessity summons readily to obey it but weeping and groaning we suffer what we do suffer and we call them circumstances what kind of circumstances man if you give the name of circumstances to the things which are around you all things are circumstances but if you call 
hardships by this name what hardship is there in the dying of that which has been produced but that which destroys is either a sword or a wheel or the sea or a tile or a tyrant why do you care about the way of going down to hades all ways are equal but if you will listen to the truth the way which the tyrant sends you is shorter a tyrant never killed a man in six months but a fever is often a year about it all these things are only sound and the noise of empty names  i am in danger of my life from caesar and am not i in danger who dwell in nicopolis where there are so many earthquakes and when you are crossing the adriatic what hazard do you run is it not the hazard of your life but i am in danger also as to opinion do you mean your own how for who can compel you to have any opinion which you do not choose but is it as to another mans opinion and what kind of danger is yours if others have false opinions but i am in danger of being banished what is it to be banished to be somewhere else than at rome yes what 
then if i should be sent to gyara if that suits you you will go there but if it does not you can go to another place instead of gyara whither he also will go who sends you to gyara whether he choose or not why then do you go up to rome as if it were something great it is not worth all this preparation that an ingenuous youth should say it was not worthwhile to have heard so much and to have written so much and to have sat so long by the side of an old man who is not worth much only remember that division by which your own and not your own are distinguished never claim anything which belongs to others a tribunal and a prison are each a place one high and the other low but the will can be maintained equal if you choose to maintain it equal in each and we shall then be imitators of socrates when we are able to write paeans in prison but in our present disposition consider if we could endure in prison another person saying to us would you like me to read paeans to you why do you trouble me do you not know the evi
ls which hold me can i in such circumstances listen to paeans what circumstances i am going to die and will other men be immortal  vii how we ought to use divination through an unreasonable regard to divination many of us omit many duties for what more can the diviner see than death or danger or disease or generally things of that kind if then i must expose myself to danger for a friend and if it is my duty even to die for him what need have i then for divination have i not within me a diviner who has told me the nature of good and of evil and has explained to me the signs or marks of both what need have i then to consult the viscera of victims or the flight of birds and why do i submit when he says it is for your interest for does he know what is for my interest does he know what is good and as he has learned the signs of the viscera has he also learned the signs of good and evil for if he knows the signs of these he knows the signs both of the beautiful and of the ugly and of the just and of the unjust do y
ou tell me man what is the thing which is signified for me is it life or death poverty or wealth but whether these things are for my interest or whether they are not i do not intend to ask you why dont you give your opinion on matters of grammar and why do you give it here about things on which we are all in error and disputing with one another the woman therefore who intended to send by a vessel a months provisions to gratilla in her banishment made a good answer to him who said that domitian would seize what she sent i would rather she replied that domitian should seize all than that i should not send it  what then leads us to frequent use of divination cowardice the dread of what will happen this is the reason why we flatter the diviners pray master shall i succeed to the property of my father let us see let us sacrifice on the occasion yes master as fortune chooses when he has said you shall succeed to the inheritance we thank him as if we received the inheritance from him the consequence is that they pla
y upon us  what then should we do we ought to come to divination without desire or aversion as the wayfarer asks of the man whom he meets which of two roads leads to his journeys end without any desire for that which leads to the right rather than to the left for he has no wish to go by any road except the road which leads to his end in the same way ought we to come to god also as a guide as we use our eyes not asking them to show us rather such things as we wish but receiving the appearances of things such as the eyes present them to us but now we trembling take the augur bird interpreter by the hand and while we invoke god we entreat the augur and say master have mercy on me suffer me to come safe out of this difficulty wretch would you have then anything other than what is best is there then anything better than what pleases god why do you as far as is in your power corrupt your judge and lead astray your adviser  viii what is the nature ἡ οὐσία of the good god is beneficial but the good also is beneficial
 it is consistent then that where the nature of god is there also the nature of the good should be what then is the nature of god flesh certainly not an estate in land by no means fame no is it intelligence knowledge right reason yes herein then simply seek the nature of the good for i suppose that you do not seek it in a plant no do you seek it in an irrational animal no if then you seek it in a rational animal why do you still seek it anywhere except in the superiority of rational over irrational animals now plants have not even the power of using appearances and for this reason you do not apply the term good to them the good then requires the use of appearances does it require this use only for if you say that it requires this use only say that the good and that happiness and unhappiness are in irrational animals also but you do not say this and you do right for if they possess even in the highest degree the use of appearances yet they have not the faculty of understanding the use of appearances and there 
is good reason for this for they exist for the purpose of serving others and they exercise no superiority for the ass i suppose does not exist for any superiority over others no but because we had need of a back which is able to bear something and in truth we had need also of his being able to walk and for this reason he received also the faculty of making use of appearances for otherwise he would not have been able to walk and here then the matter stopped for if he had also received the faculty of comprehending the use of appearances it is plain that consistently with reason he would not then have been subjected to us nor would he have done us these services but he would have been equal to us and like to us  will you not then seek the nature of good in the rational animal for if it is not there you will not choose to say that it exists in any other thing plant or animal what then are not plants and animals also the works of god they are but they are not superior things nor yet parts of the gods but you are a
 superior thing you are a portion separated from the deity you have in yourself a certain portion of him why then are you ignorant of your own noble descent why do you not know whence you came will you not remember when you are eating who you are who eat and whom you feed when you are in conjunction with a woman will you not remember who you are who do this thing when you are in social intercourse when you are exercising yourself when you are engaged in discussion know you not that you are nourishing a god that you are exercising a god wretch you are carrying about a god with you and you know it not do you think that i mean some god of silver or of gold and external you carry him within yourself and you perceive not that you are polluting him by impure thoughts and dirty deeds and if an image of god were present you would not dare to do any of the things which you are doing but when god himself is present within and sees all and hears all you are not ashamed of thinking such things and doing such things ignor
ant as you are of your own nature and subject to the anger of god then why do we fear when we are sending a young man from the school into active life lest he should do anything improperly eat improperly have improper intercourse with women and lest the rags in which he is wrapped should debase him lest fine garments should make him proud this youth if he acts thus does not know his own god he knows not with whom he sets out into the world but can we endure when he says i wish i had you god with me have you not god with you and do you seek for any other when you have him or will god tell you anything else than this if you were a statue of phidias either athena or zeus you would think both of yourself and of the artist and if you had any understanding power of perception you would try to do nothing unworthy of him who made you or of yourself and try not to appear in an unbecoming dress attitude to those who look on you but now because zeus has made you for this reason do you care not how you shall appear and y
et is the artist in the one case like the artist in the other or the work in the one case like the other and what work of an artist for instance has in itself the faculties which the artist shows in making it is it not marble or bronze or gold or ivory and the athena of phidias when she has once extended the hand and received in it the figure of victory stands in that attitude forever but the works of god have power of motion they breathe they have the faculty of using the appearances of things and the power of examining them being the work of such an artist do you dishonor him and what shall i say not only that he made you but also entrusted you to yourself and made you a deposit to yourself will you not think of this too but do you also dishonor your guardianship but if god had entrusted an orphan to you would you thus neglect him he has delivered yourself to your own care and says i had no one fitter to entrust him to than yourself keep him for me such as he is by nature modest faithful erect unterrifled f
ree from passion and perturbation and then you do not keep him such but some will say whence has this fellow got the arrogance which he displays and these supercilious looksi have not yet so much gravity as befits a philosopher for i do not yet feel confidence in what i have learned and in what i have assented to i still fear my own weakness let me get confidence and then you shall see a countenance such as i ought to have and an attitude such as i ought to have then i will show to you the statue when it is perfected when it is polished what do you expect a supercilious countenance does the zeus at olympia lift up his brow no his look is fixed as becomes him who is ready to say  irrevocable is my word and shall not fail iliad i  such will i show myself to you faithful modest noble free from perturbationwhat and immortal too exempt from old age and from sickness no but dying as becomes a god sickening as becomes a god this power i possess this i can do but the rest i do not possess nor can i do i will show the
 nerves strength of a philosopher what nerves are these a desire never disappointed an aversion which never falls on that which it would avoid a proper pursuit ὁρμήν a diligent purpose an assent which is not rash these you shall see  ix that when we cannot fulfil that which the character of a man promises we assume the character of a philosopher it is no common easy thing to do this only to fulfil the promise of a mans nature for what is a man the answer is a rational and mortal being then by the rational faculty from whom are we separated from wild beasts and from what others from sheep and like animals take care then to do nothing like a wild beastbut if you do you have lost the character of a man you have not fulfilled your promise see that you do nothing like a sheepbut if you do in this case also the man is lost what then do we do as sheep when we act gluttonously when we act lewdly when we act rashly filthily inconsiderately to what have we declined to sheep what have we lost the rational faculty when w
e act contentiously and harmfully and passionately and violently to what have we declined to wild beasts consequently some of us are great wild beasts and others little beasts of a bad disposition and small whence we may say let me be eaten by a lion but in all these ways the promise of a man acting as a man is destroyed for when is a conjunctive complex proposition maintained when it fulfils what its nature promises so that the preservation of a complex proposition is when it is a conjunction of truths when is a disjunctive maintained when it fulfils what it promises when are flutes a lyre a horse a dog preserved when they severally keep their promise what is the wonder then if man also in like manner is preserved and in like manner is lost each man is improved and preserved by corresponding acts the carpenter by acts of carpentry the grammarian by acts of grammar but if a man accustoms himself to write ungrammatically of necessity his art will be corrupted and destroyed thus modest actions preserve the mode
st man and immodest actions destroy him and actions of fidelity preserve the faithful man and the contrary actions destroy him and on the other hand contrary actions strengthen contrary characters shamelessness strengthens the shameless man faithlessness the faithless man abusive words the abusive man anger the man of an angry temper and unequal receiving and giving make the avaricious man more avaricious  for this reason philosophers admonish us not to be satisfied with learning only but also to add study and then practice for we have long been accustomed to do contrary things and we put in practice opinions which are contrary to true opinions if then we shall not also put in practice right opinions we shall be nothing more than the expositors of the opinions of others for now who among us is not able to discourse according to the rules of art about good and evil things in this fashion that of things some are good and some are bad and some are indifferent the good then are virtues and the things which partic
ipate in virtues and the bad are the contrary and the indifferent are wealth health reputationthen if in the midst of our talk there should happen some greater noise than usual or some of those who are present should laugh at us we are disturbed philosopher where are the things which you were talking about whence did you produce and utter them from the lips and thence only why then do you corrupt the aids provided by others why do you treat the weightiest matters as if you were playing a game of dice for it is one thing to lay up bread and wine as in a storehouse and another thing to eat that which has been eaten is digested distributed and is become sinews flesh bones blood healthy color healthy breath whatever is stored up when you choose you can readily take and show it but you have no other advantage from it except so far as to appear to possess it for what is the difference between explaining these doctrines and those of men who have different opinions sit down now and explain according to the rules of a
rt the opinions of epicurus and perhaps you will explain his opinions in a more useful manner than epicurus himself why then do you call yourself a stoic why do you deceive the many why do you act the part of a jew when you are a greek do you not see how why each is called a jew or a syrian or an egyptian and when we see a man inclining to two sides we are accustomed to say this man is not a jew but he acts as one but when he has assumed the affects of one who has been imbued with jewish doctrine and has adopted that sect then he is in fact and he is named a jew thus we too being falsely imbued baptized are in name jews but in fact we are something else our affects feelings are inconsistent with our words we are far from practicing what we say and that of which we are proud as if we knew it thus being unable to fulfil even what the character of a man promises we even add to it the profession of a philosopher which is as heavy a burden as if a man who is unable to bear ten pounds should attempt to raise the st
one which ajax lifted  x how we may discover the duties of life from names consider who you are in the first place you are a man and this is one who has nothing superior to the faculty of the will but all other things subjected to it and the faculty itself he possesses unenslaved and free from subjection consider then from what things you have been separated by reason you have been separated from wild beasts you have been separated from domestic animals προβάτων further you are a citizen of the world and a part of it not one of the subservient serving but one of the principal ruling parts for you are capable of comprehending the divine administration and of considering the connection of things what then does the character of a citizen promise profess to hold nothing as profitable to himself to deliberate about nothing as if he were detached from the community but to act as the hand or foot would do if they had reason and understood the constitution of nature for they would never put themselves in motion nor d
esire anything otherwise than with reference to the whole therefore the philosophers say well that if the good man had foreknowledge of what would happen he would cooperate towards his own sickness and death and mutilation since he knows that these things are assigned to him according to the universal arrangement and that the whole is superior to the part and the state to the citizen but now because we do not know the future it is our duty to stick to the things which are in their nature more suitable for our choice for we were made among other things for this  after this remember that you are a son what does this character promise to consider that everything which is the sons belongs to the father to obey him in all things never to blame him to another nor to say or do anything which does him injury to yield to him in all things and give way cooperating with him as far as you can after this know that you are a brother also and that to this character it is due to make concessions to be easily persuaded to spe
ak good of your brother never to claim in opposition to him any of the things which are independent of the will but readily to give them up that you may have the larger share in what is dependent on the will for see what a thing it is in place of a lettuce if it should so happen or a seat to gain for yourself goodness of disposition how great is the advantage  next to this if you are a senator of any state remember that you are a senator if a youth that you are a youth if an old man that you are an old man for each of such names if it comes to be examined marks out the proper duties but if you go and blame your brother i say to you you have forgotten who you are and what is your name in the next place if you were a smith and made a wrong use of the hammer you would have forgotten the smith and if you have forgotten the brother and instead of a brother have become an enemy would you appear not to have changed one thing for another in that case and if instead of a man who is a tame animal and social you are bec
ome a mischievous wild beast treacherous and biting have you lost nothing but i suppose you must lose a bit of money that you may suffer damage and does the loss of nothing else do a man damage if you had lost the art of grammar or music would you think the loss of it a damage and if you shall lose modesty moderation καταστολήν and gentleness do you think the loss nothing and yet the things first mentioned are lost by some cause external and independent of the will and the second by our own fault and as to the first neither to have them nor to lose them is shameful but as to the second not to have them and to lose them is shameful and matter of reproach and a misfortune what does the pathic lose he loses the character of man what does he lose who makes the pathic what he is many other things and he also loses the man no less than the other what does he lose who commits adultery he loses the character of the modest the temperate the decent the citizen the neighbour what does he lose who is angry something else
 what does the coward lose something else no man is bad without suffering some loss and damage if then you look for the damage in the loss of money only all these men receive no harm or damage it may be they have even profit and gain when they acquire a bit of money by any of these deeds but consider that if you refer everything to a small coin not even he who loses his nose is in your opinion damaged yes you say for he is mutilated in his body well but does he who has lost his smell only lose nothing is there then no energy of the soul which is an advantage to him who possesses it and a damage to him who has lost it tell me what sort of energy you mean have we not a natural modesty we have does he who loses this sustain no damage is he deprived of nothing does he part with nothing of the things which belong to him have we not naturally fidelity natural affection a natural disposition to help others a natural disposition to forbearance the man then who allows himself to be damaged in these matters can he be f
ree from harm and uninjured what then shall i not hurt him who has hurt me in the first place consider what hurt βλάβη is and remember what you have heard from the philosophers for if the good consists in the will purpose intention προαιρέσει and the evil also in the will see if what you say is not this what then since that man has hurt himself by doing an unjust act to me shall i not hurt myself by doing some unjust act to him why do we not imagine to ourselves mentally think of something of this kind but where there is any detriment to the body or to our possession there is harm there and where the same thing happens to the faculty of the will there is you suppose no harm for he who has been deceived or he who has done an unjust act neither suffers in the head nor in the eye nor in the hip nor does he lose his estate and we wish for nothing else than security to these things but whether we shall have the will modest and faithful or shameless and faithless we care not the least except only in the school so f
ar as a few words are concerned therefore our proficiency is limited to these few words but beyond them it does not exist even in the slightest degree  xi what the beginning of philosophy is the beginning of philosophy to him at least who enters on it in the right way and by the door is a consciousness of his own weakness and inability about necessary things for we come into the world with no natural notion of a rightangled triangle or of a diesis a quarter tone or of a half tone but we learn each of these things by a certain transmission according to art and for this reason those who do not know them do not think that they know them but as to good and evil and beautiful and ugly and becoming and unbecoming and happiness and misfortune and proper and improper and what we ought to do and what we ought not to do who ever came into the world without having an innate idea of them wherefore we all use these names and we endeavor to fit the preconceptions to the several cases things thus he has done well he has not
 done well he has done as he ought not as he ought he has been unfortunate he has been fortunate he is unjust he is just who does not use these names who among us defers the use of them till he has learned them as he defers the use of the words about lines geometrical figures or sounds and the cause of this is that we come into the world already taught as it were by nature some things on this matter τόπον and proceeding from these we have added to them selfconceit οἴησιν for why a man says do i not know the beautiful and the ugly have i not the notion of it you have do i not adapt it to particulars you do do i not then adapt it properly in that lies the whole question and conceit is added here for beginning from these things which are admitted men proceed to that which is matter of dispute by means of unsuitable adaptation for if they possessed this power of adaptation in addition to those things what would hinder them from being perfect but now since you think that you properly adapt the preconceptions to th
e particulars tell me whence you derive this assume that you do so because i think so but it does not seem so to another and he thinks that he also makes a proper adaptation or does he not think so he does think so is it possible then that both of you can properly apply the preconceptions to things about which you have contrary opinions it is not possible can you then show us anything better towards adapting the preconceptions beyond your thinking that you do does the madman do any other things than the things which seem to him right is then this criterion sufficient for him also it is not sufficient come then to something which is superior to seeming τοῦ δοκεῖν what is this  observe this is the beginning of philosophy a perception of the disagreement of men with one another and an inquiry into the cause of the disagreement and a condemnation and distrust of that which only seems and a certain investigation of that which seems whether it seems rightly and a discovery of some rule κανόνος as we have discovered
 a balance in the determination of weights and a carpenters rule or square in the case of straight and crooked thingsthis is the beginning of philosophy must we say that all things are right which seem so to all and how is it possible that contradictions can be rightnot all then but all which seem to us to be righthow more to you than those which seem right to the syrians why more than what seem right to the egyptians why more than what seems right to me or to any other man not at all more what then seems to every man is not sufficient for determining what is for neither in the case of weights or measures are we satisfied with the bare appearance but in each case we have discovered a certain rule in this matter then is there no rule superior to what seems and how is it possible that the most necessary things among men should have no sign mark and be incapable of being discovered there is then some rule and why then do we not seek the rule and discover it and afterwards use it without varying from it not even 
stretching out the finger without it for this i think is that which when it is discovered cures of their madness those who use mere seeming as a measure and misuse it so that for the future proceeding from certain things principles known and made clear we may use in the case of particular things the preconceptions which are distinctly fixed  what is the matter presented to us about which we are inquiring pleasure for example subject it to the rule throw it into the balance ought the good to be such a thing that it is fit that we have confidence in it yes and in which we ought to confide it ought to be is it fit to trust to anything which is insecure no is then pleasure anything secure no take it then and throw it out of the scale and drive it far away from the place of good things but if you are not sharpsighted and one balance is not enough for you bring another is it fit to be elated over what is good yes is it proper then to be elated over present pleasure see that you do not say that it is proper but if y
ou do i shall then not think you worthy even of the balance thus things are tested and weighed when the rules are ready and to philosophize is this to examine and confirm the rules and then to use them when they are known is the act of a wise and good man  xii of disputation or discussion what things a man must learn in order to be able to apply the art of disputation has been accurately shown by our philosophers the stoics but with respect to the proper use of the things we are entirely without practice only give to any of us whom you please an illiterate man to discuss with and he cannot discover how to deal with the man but when he has moved the man a little if he answers beside the purpose he does not know how to treat him but he then either abuses or ridicules him and says he is an illiterate man it is not possible to do anything with him now a guide when he has found a man out of the road leads him into the right way he does not ridicule or abuse him and then leave him do you also show the illiterate ma
n the truth and you will see that he follows but so long as you do not show him the truth do not ridicule him but rather feel your own incapacity  how then did socrates act he used to compel his adversary in disputation to bear testimony to him and he wanted no other witness therefore he could say i care not for other witnesses but i am always satisfied with the evidence testimony of my adversary and i do not ask the opinion of others but only the opinion of him who is disputing with me for he used to make the conclusions drawn from natural notions so plain that every man saw the contradiction if it existed and withdrew from it thus does the envious man rejoice by no means but he is rather pained well do you think that envy is pain over evils and what envy is there of evils therefore he made his adversary say that envy is pain over good things well then would any man envy those who are nothing to him by no means thus having completed the notion and distinctly fixed it he would go away without saying to his ad
versary define to me envy and if the adversary had defined envy he did not say you have defined it badly for the terms of the definition do not correspond to the thing definedthese are technical terms and for this reason disagreeable and hardly intelligible to illiterate men which terms we philosophers cannot lay aside but that the illiterate man himself who follows the appearances presented to him should be able to concede anything or reject it we can never by the use of these terms move him to do accordingly being conscious of our own inability we do not attempt the thing at least such of us as have any caution do not but the greater part and the rash when they enter into such disputations confuse themselves and confuse others and finally abusing their adversaries and abused by them they walk away now this was the first and chief peculiarity of socrates never to be irritated in argument never to utter anything abusive anything insulting but to bear with abusive persons and to put an end to the quarrel if yo
u would know what great power he had in this way read the symposium of xenophon and you will see how many quarrels he put an end to hence with good reason in the poets also this power is most highly praised  quickly with skill he settles great disputes hesiod theogony v  well then the matter is not now very safe and particularly at rome for he who attempts to do it must not do it in a corner you may be sure but must go to a man of consular rank if it so happen or to a rich man and ask him can you tell me sir to whose care you have entrusted your horses i can tell you have you entrusted them to any person indifferently and to one who has no experience of horses by no means well then can you tell me to whom you entrust your gold or silver things or your vestments i dont entrust even these to anyone indifferently well your own body have you already considered about entrusting the care of it to any person certainly to a man of experience i suppose and one acquainted with the aliptic or with the healing art withou
t doubt are these the best things that you have or do you also possess something else which is better than all these what kind of a thing do you mean that i mean which makes use of these things and tests each of them and deliberates is it the soul that you mean you think right for it is the soul that i mean in truth i do think that the soul is a much better thing than all the others which i possess can you then show us in what way you have taken care of the soul for it is not likely that you who are so wise a man and have a reputation in the city inconsiderately and carelessly allow the most valuable thing that you possess to be neglected and to perish certainly not but have you taken care of the soul yourself and have you learned from another to do this or have you discovered the means yourself here comes the danger that in the first place he may say what is this to you my good man who are you next if you persist in troubling him there is danger that he may raise his hands and give you blows i was once mysel
f also an admirer of this mode of instruction until i fell into these dangers  xiii on anxiety solicitude when i see a man anxious i say what does this man want if he did not want something which is not in his power how could he be anxious for this reason a lute player when he is singing by himself has no anxiety but when he enters the theatre he is anxious even if he has a good voice and plays well on the lute for he not only wishes to sing well but also to obtain applause but this is not in his power accordingly where he has skill there he has confidence bring any single person who knows nothing of music and the musician does not care for him but in the matter where a man knows nothing and has not been practiced there he is anxious what matter is this he knows not what a crowd is or what the praise of a crowd is however he has learned to strike the lowest chord and the highest but what the praise of the many is and what power it has in life he neither knows nor has he thought about it hence he must of neces
sity tremble and grow pale i cannot then say that a man is not a lute player when i see him afraid but i can say something else and not one thing but many and first of all i call him a stranger and say this man does not know in what part of the world he is but though he has been here so long he is ignorant of the laws of the state and the customs and what is permitted and what is not and he has never employed any lawyer to tell him and to explain the laws but a man does not write a will if he does not know how it ought to be written or he employs a person who does know nor does he rashly seal a bond or write a security but he uses his desire without a lawyers advice and aversion and pursuit movement and attempt and purpose how do you mean without a lawyer he does not know that he wills what is not allowed and does not will that which is of necessity and he does not know either what is his own or what is another mans but if he did know he would never be impeded he would never be hindered he would not be anxiou
s how so is any man then afraid about things which are not evilsnois he afraid about things which are evils but still so far within his power that they may not happencertainly he is notif then the things which are independent of the will are neither good nor bad and all things which do depend on the will are within our power and no man can either take them from us or give them to us if we do not choose where is room left for anxiety but we are anxious about our poor body our little property about the will of caesar but not anxious about things internal are we anxious about not forming a false opinionno for this is in my powerabout not exerting our movements contrary to natureno not even about thiswhen then you see a man pale as the physician says judging from the complexion this mans spleen is disordered that mans liver so also say this mans desire and aversion are disordered he is not in the right way he is in a fever for nothing else changes the color or causes trembling or chattering of the teeth or causes
 a man to  sink in his knees and shift from foot to foot iliad xiii  for this reason when zeno was going to meet antigonus he was not anxious for antigonus had no power over any of the things which zeno admired and zeno did not care for those things over which antigonus had power but antigonus was anxious when he was going to meet zeno for he wished to please zeno but this was a thing external out of his power but zeno did not want to please antigonus for no man who is skilled in any art wishes to please one who has no such skill  should i try to please you why i suppose you know the measure by which one man is estimated by another have you taken pains to learn what is a good man and what is a bad man and how a man becomes one or the other why then are you not good yourself how he replies am i not good because no good man laments or groans or weeps no good man is pale and trembles or says how will he receive me how will he listen to me slave just as it pleases him why do you care about what belongs to others 
is it now his fault if he receives badly what proceeds from you certainly and is it possible that a fault should be one mans and the evil in another no why then are you anxious about that which belongs to others your question is reasonable but i am anxious how i shall speak to him cannot you then speak to him as you choose but i fear that i may be disconcerted if you are going to write the name of dion are you afraid that you would be disconcerted by no means why is it not because you have practiced writing the name certainly well if you were going to read the name would you not feel the same and why because every art has a certain strength and confidence in the things which belong to ithave you then not practiced speaking and what else did you learn in the school syllogisms and sophistical propositions for what purpose was it not for the purpose of discoursing skillfully and is not discoursing skillfully the same as discoursing seasonably and cautiously and with intelligence and also without making mistakes 
and without hindrance and besides all this with confidence yes when then you are mounted on a horse and go into a plain are you anxious at being matched against a man who is on foot and anxious in a matter in which you are practiced and he is not yes but that person to whom i am going to speak has power to kill me speak the truth then unhappy man and do not brag nor claim to be a philosopher nor refuse to acknowledge your masters but so long as you present this handle in your body follow every man who is stronger than yourself socrates used to practice speaking he who talked as he did to the tyrants to the dicasts judges he who talked in his prison diogenes had practiced speaking he who spoke as he did to alexander to the pirates to the person who bought him these men were confident in the things which they practiced but do you walk off to your own affairs and never leave them go and sit in a corner and weave syllogisms and propose them to another there is not in you the man who can rule a state  xiv to naso 
when a certain roman entered with his son and listened to one reading epictetus said this is the method of instruction and he stopped when the roman asked him to go on epictetus said every art when it is taught causes labor to him who is unacquainted with it and is unskilled in it and indeed the things which proceed from the arts immediately show their use in the purpose for which they were made and most of them contain something attractive and pleasing for indeed to be present and to observe how a shoemaker learns is not a pleasant thing but the shoe is useful and also not disagreeable to look at and the discipline of a smith when he is learning is very disagreeable to one who chances to be present and is a stranger to the art but the work shows the use of the art but you will see this much more in music for if you are present while a person is learning the discipline will appear most disagreeable and yet the results of music are pleasing and delightful to those who know nothing of music and here we conceive
 the work of a philosopher to be something of this kind he must adapt his wish βούλησιν to what is going on so that neither any of the things which are taking place shall take place contrary to our wish nor any of the things which do not take place shall not take place when we wish that they should from this the result is to those who have so arranged the work of philosophy not to fail in the desire nor to fall in with that which they would avoid without uneasiness without fear without perturbation to pass through life themselves together with their associates maintaining the relations both natural and acquired as the relation of son of father of brother of citizen of man of wife of neighbour of fellow traveller of ruler of ruled the work of a philosopher we conceive to be something like this it remains next to inquire how this must be accomplished  we see then that the carpenter τέκτων when he has learned certain things becomes a carpenter the pilot by learning certain things becomes a pilot may it not then 
in philosophy also not be sufficient to wish to be wise and good and that there is also a necessity to learn certain things we inquire then what these things are the philosophers say that we ought first to learn that there is a god and that he provides for all things also that it is not possible to conceal from him our acts or even our intentions and thoughts the next thing is to learn what is the nature of the gods for such as they are discovered to be he who would please and obey them must try with all his power to be like them if the divine is faithful man also must be faithful if it is free man also must be free if beneficent man also must be beneficent if magnanimous man also must be magnanimous as being then an imitator of god he must do and say everything consistently with this fact  with what then must we begin if you will enter on the discussion i will tell you that you must first understand names words so then you say that i do not now understand names you do not understand them how then do i use th
em just as the illiterate use written language as cattle use appearances for use is one thing understanding is another but if you think that you understand them produce whatever word you please and let us try whether we understand it but it is a disagreeable thing for a man to be confuted who is now old and it may be has now served his three campaigns i too know this for now you are come to me as if you were in want of nothing and what could you even imagine to be wanting to you you are rich you have children and a wife perhaps and many slaves caesar knows you in rome you have many friends you render their dues to all you know how to requite him who does you a favor and to repay in the same kind him who does you a wrong what do you lack if then i shall show you that you lack the things most necessary and the chief things for happiness and that hitherto you have looked after everything rather than what you ought and to crown all that you neither know what god is nor what man is nor what is good nor what is bad
 and as to what i have said about your ignorance of other matters that may perhaps be endured but if i say that you know nothing about yourself how is it possible that you should endure me and bear the proof and stay here it is not possible but you immediately go off in bad humor and yet what harm have i done you unless the mirror also injures the ugly man because it shows him to himself such as he is unless the physician also is supposed to insult the sick man when he says to him man do you think that you ail nothing but you have a fever go without food today drink water and no one says what an insult but if you say to a man your desires are inflamed your aversions are low your intentions are inconsistent your pursuits movements are not conformable to nature your opinions are rash and false the man immediately goes away and says he has insulted me  our way of dealing is like that of a crowded assembly beasts are brought to be sold and oxen and the greater part of the men come to buy and sell and there are so
me few who come to look at the market and to inquire how it is carried on and why and who fixes the meeting and for what purpose so it is here also in this assembly of life some like cattle trouble themselves about nothing except their fodder for to all of you who are busy about possessions and lands and slaves and magisterial offices these are nothing except fodder but there are a few who attend the assembly men who love to look on and consider what is the world who governs it has it no governor and how is it possible that a city or a family cannot continue to exist not even the shortest time without an administrator and guardian and that so great and beautiful a system should be administered with such order and yet without a purpose and by chance there is then an administrator what kind of administrator and how does he govern and who are we who were produced by him and for what purpose have we some connection with him and some relation towards him or none this is the way in which these few are affected and 
then they apply themselves only to this one thing to examine the meeting and then to go away what then they are ridiculed by the many as the spectators at the fair are by the traders and if the beasts had any understanding they would ridicule those who admired anything else than fodder  xv to or against those who obstinately persist in what they have determined when some persons have heard these words that a man ought to be constant firm and that the will is naturally free and not subject to compulsion but that all other things are subject to hindrance to slavery and are in the power of others they suppose that they ought without deviation to abide by everything which they have determined but in the first place that which has been determined ought to be sound true i require tone sinews in the body but such as exists in a healthy body in an athletic body but if it is plain to me that you have the tone of a frenzied man and you boast of it i shall say to you man seek the physician this is not tone but atony def
iciency in right tone in a different way something of the same kind is felt by those who listen to these discourses in a wrong manner which was the case with one of my companions who for no reason resolved to starve himself to death i heard of it when it was the third day of his abstinence from food and i went to inquire what had happened i have resolved he saidbut still tell me what it was which induced you to resolve for if you have resolved rightly we shall sit with you and assist you to depart but if you have made an unreasonable resolution change your mind we ought to keep to our determinations what are you doing man we ought to keep not to all our determinations but to those which are right for if you are now persuaded that it is night do not change your mind if you think fit but persist and say we ought to abide by our determinations will you not make the beginning and lay the foundation in an inquiry whether the determination is sound or not sound and so then build on it firmness and security but if y
ou lay a rotten and ruinous foundation will not your miserable little building fall down the sooner the more and the stronger are the materials which you shall lay on it without any reason would you withdraw from us out of life a man who is a friend and a companion a citizen of the same city both the great and the small city then while you are committing murder and destroying a man who has done no wrong do you say that you ought to abide by your determinations and if it ever in any way came into your head to kill me ought you to abide by your determinations  now this man was with difficulty persuaded to change his mind but it is impossible to convince some persons at present so that i seem now to know what i did not know before the meaning of the common saying that you can neither persuade nor break a fool may it never be my lot to have a wise fool for my friend nothing is more untractable i am determined the man says madmen are also but the more firmly they form a judgment on things which do not exist the mo
re hellebore they require will you not act like a sick man and call in the physiciani am sick master help me consider what i must do it is my duty to obey you so it is here also i know not what i ought to do but i am come to learn not so but speak to me about other things upon this i have determined what other things for what is greater and more useful than for you to be persuaded that it is not sufficient to have made your determination and not to change it this is the tone energy of madness not of health i will die if you compel me to this why man what has happened i have determined i have had a lucky escape that you have not determined to kill me i take no money why i have determined be assured that with the very tone energy which you now use in refusing to take there is nothing to hinder you at some time from inclining without reason to take money and then saying i have determined as in a distempered body subject to defluxions the humor inclines sometimes to these parts and then to those so too a sickly s
oul knows not which way to incline but if to this inclination and movement there is added a tone obstinate resolution then the evil becomes past help and cure  xvi that we do not strive to use our opinions about good and evil where is the good in the will where is the evil in the will where is neither of them in those things which are independent of the will well then does anyone among us think of these lessons out of the schools does anyone meditate strive by himself to give an answer to things as in the case of questions is it dayyesis it nightnowell is the number of stars eveni cannot saywhen money is shown offered to you have you studied to make the proper answer that money is not a good thing have you practiced yourself in these answers or only against sophisms why do you wonder then if in the cases which you have studied in those you have improved but in those which you have not studied in those you remain the same when the rhetorician knows that he has written well that he has committed to memory what 
he has written and brings an agreeable voice why is he still anxious because he is not satisfied with having studied what then does he want to be praised by the audience for the purpose then of being able to practice declamation he has been disciplined but with respect to praise and blame he has not been disciplined for when did he hear from anyone what praise is what blame is what the nature of each is what kind of praise should be sought or what kind of blame should be shunned and when did he practice this discipline which follows these words things why then do you still wonder if in the matters which a man has learned there he surpasses others and in those in which he has not been disciplined there he is the same with the many so the lute player knows how to play sings well and has a fine dress and yet he trembles when he enters on the stage for these matters he understands but he does not know what a crowd is nor the shouts of a crowd nor what ridicule is neither does he know what anxiety is whether it is
 our work or the work of another whether it is possible to stop it or not for this reason if he has been praised he leaves the theatre puffed up but if he has been ridiculed the swollen bladder has been punctured and subsides  this is the case also with ourselves what do we admire externals about what things are we busy externals and have we any doubt then why we fear or why we are anxious what then happens when we think the things which are coming on us to be evils it is not in our power not to be afraid it is not in our power not to be anxious then we say lord god how shall i not be anxious fool have you not hands did not god make them for you sit down now and pray that your nose may not run wipe yourself rather and do not blame him well then has he given to you nothing in the present case has he not given to you endurance has he not given to you magnanimity has he not given to you manliness when you have such hands do you still look for one who shall wipe your nose but we neither study these things nor car
e for them give me a man who cares how he shall do anything not for the obtaining of a thing but who cares about his own energy what man when he is walking about cares for his own energy who when he is deliberating cares about his own deliberation and not about obtaining that about which he deliberates and if he succeeds he is elated and says how well we have deliberated did i not tell you brother that it is impossible when we have thought about anything that it should not turn out thus but if the thing should turn out otherwise the wretched man is humbled he knows not even what to say about what has taken place who among us for the sake of this matter has consulted a seer who among us as to his actions has not slept in indifference who give name to me one that i may see the man whom i have long been looking for who is truly noble and ingenuous whether young or old name him  why then are we still surprised if we are well practiced in thinking about matters any given subject but in our acts are low without dec
ency worthless cowardly impatient of labor altogether bad for we do not care about these things nor do we study them but if we had feared not death or banishment but fear itself we should have studied not to fall into those things which appear to us evils now in the school we are irritable and wordy and if any little question arises about any of these things we are able to examine them fully but drag us to practice and you will find us miserably shipwrecked let some disturbing appearance come on us and you will know what we have been studying and in what we have been exercising ourselves consequently through want of discipline we are always adding something to the appearance and representing things to be greater than what they are for instance as to myself when i am on a voyage and look down on the deep sea or look round on it and see no land i am out of my mind and imagine that i must drink up all this water if i am wrecked and it does not occur to me that three pints are enough what then disturbs me the sea
 no but my opinion again when an earthquake shall happen i imagine that the city is going to fall on me but is not one little stone enough to knock my brains out  what then are the things which are heavy on us and disturb us what else than opinions what else than opinions lies heavy upon him who goes away and leaves his companions and friends and places and habits of life now little children for instance when they cry on the nurse leaving them for a short time forget their sorrow if they receive a small cake do you choose then that we should compare you to little childrenno by zeus for i do not wish to be pacified by a small cake but by right opinionsand what are these such as a man ought to study all day and not to be affected by anything that is not his own neither by companion nor place nor gymnasia and not even by his own body but to remember the law and to have it before his eyes and what is the divine law to keep a mans own not to claim that which belongs to others but to use what is given and when it i
s not given not to desire it and when a thing is taken away to give it up readily and immediately and to be thankful for the time that a man has had the use of it if you would not cry for your nurse and mamma for what matter does it make by what thing a man is subdued and on what he depends in what respect are you better than he who cries for a girl if you grieve for a little gymnasium and little porticoes and young men and such places of amusement another comes and laments that he shall no longer drink the water of dirce is the marcian water worse than that of dirce but i was used to the water of dirce and you in turn will be used to the other then if you become attached to this also cry for this too and try to make a verse like the verse of euripides  the hot baths of nero and the marcian water see how tragedy is made when common things happen to silly men  when then shall i see athens again and the acropolis wretch are you not content with what you see daily have you anything better or greater to see than 
the sun the moon the stars the whole earth the sea but if indeed you comprehend him who administers the whole and carry him about in yourself do you still desire small stones and a beautiful rock when then you are going to leave the sun itself and the moon what will you do will you sit and weep like children well what have you been doing in the school what did you hear what did you learn why did you write yourself a philosopher when you might have written the truth as i made certain introductions and i read chrysippus but i did not even approach the door of a philosopher for how should i possess anything of the kind which socrates possessed who died as he did who lived as he did or anything such as diogenes possessed do you think that any one of such men wept or grieved because he was not going to see a certain man or a certain woman nor to be in athens or in corinth but if it should so happen in susa or in ecbatana for if a man can quit the banquet when he chooses and no longer amuse himself does he still st
ay and complain and does he not stay as at any amusement only so long as he is pleased such a man i suppose would endure perpetual exile or to be condemned to death will you not be weaned now like children and take more solid food and not cry after mammas and nurses which are the lamentations of old women but if i go away i shall cause them sorrow you cause them sorrow by no means but that will cause them sorrow which also causes you sorrow opinion what have you to do then take away your own opinion and if these women are wise they will take away their own if they do not they will lament through their own fault  my man as the proverb says make a desperate effort on behalf of tranquillity of mind freedom and magnanimity lift up your head at last as released from slavery dare to look up to god and say deal with me for the future as thou wilt i am of the same mind as thou art i am thine i refuse nothing that pleases thee lead me where thou wilt clothe me in any dress thou choosest is it thy will that i should ho
ld the office of a magistrate that i should be in the condition of a private man stay here or be an exile be poor be rich i will make thy defense to men in behalf of all these conditions i will show the nature of each thing what it is you will not do so but sit in an oxs belly and wait for your mamma till she shall feed you who would hercules have been if he had sat at home he would have been eurystheus and not hercules well and in his travels through the world how many intimates and how many friends had he but nothing more dear to him than god for this reason it was believed that he was the son of god and he was in obedience to god then he went about purging away injustice and lawlessness but you are not hercules and you are not able to purge away the wickedness of others nor yet are you theseus able to purge away the evil things of attica clear away your own from yourself from your thoughts cast away instead of procrustes and sciron sadness fear desire envy malevolence avarice effeminacy intemperance but it
 is not possible to eject these things otherwise than by looking to god only by fixing your affections on him only by being consecrated to his commands but if you choose anything else you will with sighs and groans be compelled to follow what is stronger than yourself always seeking tranquillity and never able to find it for you seek tranquillity there where it is not and you neglect to seek it where it is  xvii how we must adapt preconceptions to particular cases what is the first business of him who philosophizes to throw away selfconceit οἴησις for it is impossible for a man to begin to learn that which he thinks that he knows as to things then which ought to be done and ought not to be done and good and bad and beautiful and ugly all of us talking of them at random go to the philosophers and on these matters we praise we censure we accuse we blame we judge and determine about principles honorable and dishonorable but why do we go to the philosophers because we wish to learn what we do not think that we kn
ow and what is this theorems for we wish to learn what philosophers say as being something elegant and acute and some wish to learn that they may get profit from what they learn it is ridiculous then to think that a person wishes to learn one thing and will learn another or further that a man will make proficiency in that which he does not learn but the many are deceived by this which deceived also the rhetorician theopompus when he blames even plato for wishing everything to be defined for what does he say did none of us before you use the words good or just or do we utter the sounds in an unmeaning and empty way without understanding what they severally signify now who tells you theopompus that we had not natural notions of each of these things and preconceptions προλήψεις but it is not possible to adapt preconceptions to their correspondent objects if we have not distinguished analyzed them and inquired what object must be subjected to each preconception you may make the same charge against physicians also
 for who among us did not use the words healthy and unhealthy before hippocrates lived or did we utter these words as empty sounds for we have also a certain preconception of health but we are not able to adapt it for this reason one says abstain from food another says give food another says bleed and another says use cupping what is the reason is it any other than that a man cannot properly adapt the preconception of health to particulars  so it is in this matter also in the things which concern life who among us does not speak of good and bad of useful and not useful for who among us has not a preconception of each of these things is it then a distinct and perfect preconception show this how shall i show this adapt the preconception properly to the particular things plato for instance subjects definitions to the preconception of the useful but you to the preconception of the useless is it possible then that both of you are right how is it possible does not one man adapt the preconception of good to the matt
er of wealth and another not to wealth but to the matter of pleasure and to that of health for generally if all of us who use those words know sufficiently each of them and need no diligence in resolving making distinct the notions of the preconceptions why do we differ why do we quarrel why do we blame one another  and why do i now allege this contention with one another and speak of it if you yourself properly adapt your preconceptions why are you unhappy why are you hindered let us omit at present the second topic about the pursuits ὅρμας and the study of the duties which relate to them let us omit also the third topic which relates to the assents συγκαταθέσεις i give up to you these two topics let us insist upon the first which presents an almost obvious demonstration that we do not properly adapt the preconceptions do you now desire that which is possible and that which is possible to you why then are you hindered why are you unhappy do you not now try to avoid the unavoidable why then do you fall in wit
h anything which you would avoid why are you unfortunate why when you desire a thing does it not happen and when you do not desire it does it happen for this is the greatest proof of unhappiness and misery i wish for something and it does not happen and what is more wretched than i  it was because she could not endure this that medea came to murder her children an act of a noble spirit in this view at least for she had a just opinion what it is for a thing not to succeed which a person wishes then she says thus i shall be avenged on him my husband who has wronged and insulted me and what shall i gain if he is punished thus how then shall it be done i shall kill my children but i shall punish myself also and what do i care this is the aberration of soul which possesses great energy for she did not know wherein lies the doing of that which we wish that you cannot get this from without nor yet by the alteration and new adaptation of things do not desire the man jason medeas husband and nothing which you desire w
ill fail to happen do not obstinately desire that he shall live with you do not desire to remain in gerinth and in a word desire nothing than that which god willsand who shall hinder you who shall compel you no man shall compel you any more than he shall compel zeus  when you have such a guide and your wishes and desires are the same as his why do you still fear disappointment give up your desire to wealth and your aversion to poverty and you will be disappointed in the one you will fall into the other well give them up to health and you will be unfortunate give them up to magistracies honors country friends children in a word to any of the things which are not in mans power and you will be unfortunate but give them up to zeus and to the rest of the gods surrender them to the gods let the gods govern let your desire and aversion be ranged on the side of the gods and wherein will you be any longer unhappy but if lazy wretch you envy and complain and are jealous and fear and never cease for a single day complai
ning both of yourself and of the gods why do you still speak of being educated what kind of an education man do you mean that you have been employed about sophistical syllogisms συλλογισμοὺς μεταπίπτοντας will you not if it is possible unlearn all these things and begin from the beginning and see at the same time that hitherto you have not even touched the matter and then commencing from this foundation will you not build up all that comes after so that nothing may happen which you do not choose and nothing shall fail to happen which you do choose  give me one young man who has come to the school with this intention who is become a champion for this matter and says i give up everything else and it is enough for me if it shall ever be in my power to pass my life free from hindrance and free from trouble and to stretch out present my neck to all things like a free man and to look up to heaven as a friend of god and fear nothing that can happen let any of you point out such a man that i may say come young man in
to the possession of that which is your own for it is your destiny to adorn philosophy yours are these possessions yours these books yours these discourses then when he shall have labored sufficiently and exercised himself in this part of the matter τόπον let him come to me again and say i desire to be free from passion and free from perturbation and i wish as a pious man and a philosopher and a diligent person to know what is my duty to the gods what to my parents what to my brothers what to my country what to strangers i say come also to the second matter τόπον this also is yoursbut i have now sufficiently studied the second part τόπον also and i would gladly be secure and unshaken and not only when i am awake but also when i am asleep and when i am filled with wine and when i am melancholy man you are a god you have great designs  no but i wish to understand what chrysippus says in his treatise of the pseudomenos the liar will you not hang yourself wretch with such your intention and what good will it do y
ou you will read the whole with sorrow and you will speak to others trembling thus you also do do you wish me brother to read to you and you to meyou write excellently my man and you also excellently in the style of xenophon and you in the style of plato and you in the style of antisthenes then having told your dreams to one another you return to the same things your desires are the same your aversions the same your pursuits are the same and your designs and purposes you wish for the same things and work for the same in the next place you do not even seek for one to give you advice but you are vexed if you hear such things as i say then you say an illnatured old fellow when i was going away he did not weep nor did he say into what danger you are going if you come off safe my child i will burn lights this is what a good natured man would do it will be a great thing for you if you do return safe and it will be worthwhile to burn lights for such a person for you ought to be immortal and exempt from disease  cast
ing away then as i say this conceit of thinking that we know something useful we must come to philosophy as we apply to geometry and to music but if we do not we shall not even approach to proficiency though we read all the collections and commentaries of chrysippus and those of antipater and archedemus  xviii how we should struggle against appearances every habit and faculty is maintained and increased by the corresponding actions the habit of walking by walking the habit of running by running if you would be a good reader read if a writer write but when you shall not have read for thirty days in succession but have done something else you will know the consequence in the same way if you shall have lain down ten days get up and attempt to make a long walk and you will see how your legs are weakened generally then if you would make anything a habit do it if you would not make it a habit do not do it but accustom yourself to do something else in place of it  so it is with respect to the affections of the soul 
when you have been angry you must know that not only has this evil befallen you but that you have also increased the habit and in a manner thrown fuel upon fire when you have been overcome in sexual intercourse with a person do not reckon this single defeat only but reckon that you have also nurtured increased your incontinence for it is impossible for habits and faculties some of them not to be produced when they did not exist before and others not be increased and strengthened by corresponding acts  in this manner certainly as philosophers say also diseases of the mind grow up for when you have once desired money if reason be applied to lead to a perception of the evil the desire is stopped and the ruling faculty of our mind is restored to the original authority but if you apply no means of cure it no longer returns to the same state but being again excited by the corresponding appearance it is inflamed to desire quicker than before and when this takes place continually it is henceforth hardened made callou
s and the disease of the mind confirms the love of money for he who has had a fever and has been relieved from it is not in the same state that he was before unless he has been completely cured something of the kind happens also in diseases of the soul certain traces and blisters are left in it and unless a man shall completely efface them when he is again lashed on the same places the lash will produce not blisters weals but sores if then you wish not to be of an angry temper do not feed the habit throw nothing on it which will increase it at first keep quiet and count the days on which you have not been angry i used to be in passion every day now every second day then every third then every fourth but if you have intermitted thirty days make a sacrifice to god for the habit at first begins to be weakened and then is completely destroyed i have not been vexed today nor the day after nor yet on any succeeding day during two or three months but i took care when some exciting things happened be assured that you
 are in a good way today when i saw a handsome person i did not say to myself i wish i could lie with her and happy is her husband for he who says this says happy is her adulterer also nor do i picture the rest to my mind the woman present and stripping herself and lying down by my side i stroke my head and say well done epictetus you have solved a fine little sophism much finer than that which is called the master sophism and if even the woman is willing and gives signs and sends messages and if she also fondle me and come close to me and i should abstain and be victorious that would be a sophism beyond that which is named the liar and the quiescent over such a victory as this a man may justly be proud not for proposing the master sophism  how then shall this be done be willing at length to be approved by yourself be willing to appear beautiful to god desire to be in purity with your own pure self and with god then when any such appearance visits you plato says have recourse to expiations go a suppliant to t
he temples of the averting deities it is even sufficient if you resort to the society of noble and just men and compare yourself with them whether you find one who is living or dead go to socrates and see him lying down with alcibiades and mocking his beauty consider what a victory he at last found that he had gained over himself what an olympian victory in what number he stood from hercules so that by the gods one may justly salute him hail wondrous man you who have conquered not these sorry boxers and pancratiasts nor yet those who are like them the gladiators by placing these objects on the other side you will conquer the appearance you will not be drawn away by it but in the first place be not hurried away by the rapidity of the appearance but say appearances wait for me a little let me see who you are and what you are about let me put you to the test and then do not allow the appearance to lead you on and draw lively pictures of the things which will follow for if you do it will carry you off wherever it
 pleases but rather bring in to oppose it some other beautiful and noble appearance and cast out this base appearance and if you are accustomed to be exercised in this way you will see what shoulders what sinews what strength you have but now it is only trifling words and nothing more  this is the true athlete the man who exercises himself against such appearances stay wretch do not be carried way great is the combat divine is the work it is for kingship for freedom for happiness for freedom from perturbation remember god call on him as a helper and protector as men at sea call on the dioscuri in a storm for what is a greater storm than that which comes from appearances which are violent and drive away the reason for the storm itself what else is it but an appearance for take away the fear of death and suppose as many thunders and lightnings as you please and you will know what calm and serenity there is in the ruling faculty but if you have once been defeated and say that you will conquer hereafter and then 
say the same again be assured that you will at last be in so wretched a condition and so weak that you will not even know afterwards that you are doing wrong but you will even begin to make apologies defenses for your wrongdoing and then you will confirm the saying of hesiod to be true  with constant ills the dilatory strives xix against those who embrace philosophical opinions only in words the argument called the ruling argument ὁ κυριεύων λόγος appears to have been proposed from such principles as these there is in fact a common contradiction between one another in these three propositions each two being in contradiction to the third the propositions are that everything past must of necessity be true that an impossibility does not follow a possibility and that a thing is possible which neither is nor will be true diodorus observing this contradiction employed the probative force of the first two for the demonstration of this proposition that nothing is possible which is not true and never will be now anoth
er will hold these two that something is possible which is neither true nor ever will be and that an impossibility does not follow a possibility but he will not allow that everything which is past is necessarily true as the followers of cleanthes seem to think and antipater copiously defended them but others maintain the other two propositions that a thing is possible which is neither true nor will be true and that everything which is past is necessarily true but then they will maintain that an impossibility can follow a possibility but it is impossible to maintain these three propositions because of their common contradiction  if then any man should ask me which of these propositions do you maintain i will answer him that i do not know but i have received this story that diodorus maintained one opinion the followers of panthoides i think and cleanthes maintained another opinion and those of chrysippus a third what then is your opinion i was not made for this purpose to examine the appearances that occur to m
e and to compare what others say and to form an opinion of my own on the thing therefore i differ not at all from the grammarian who was hectors father priam who were his brothers alexander and deiphobus who was their mother hecubai have heard this story from whom from homer and hellanicus also i think writes about the same things and perhaps others like him and what further have i about the ruling argument nothing but if i am a vain man especially at a banquet i surprise the guests by enumerating those who have written on these matters both chrysippus has written wonderfully in his first book about possibilities and cleanthes has written specially on the subject and archedemus antipater also has written not only in his work about possibilities but also separately in his work on the ruling argument have you not read the work i have not read it read and what profit will a man have from it he will be more trifling and impertinent than he is now for what else have you gained by reading it what opinion have you f
ormed on this subject none but you will tell us of helen and priam and the island of calypso which never was and never will be and in this matter indeed it is of no great importance if you retain the story but have formed no opinion of your own but in matters of morality ethic this happens to us much more than in these things of which we are speaking  speak to me about good and evil listen  the wind from ilium to ciconian shores brought me odyssey ix  of things some are good some are bad and others are indifferent the good then are the virtues and the things which partake of the virtues the bad are the vices and the things which partake of them and the indifferent are the things which lie between the virtues and the vices wealth health life death pleasure pain whence do you know this hellanicus says it in his egyptian history for what difference does it make to say this or to say that diogenes has it in his ethic or chrysippus or cleanthes have you then examined any of these things and formed an opinion of yo
ur own show how you are used to behave in a storm on shipboard do you remember this division distinction of things when the sail rattles and a man who knows nothing of times and seasons stands by you when you are screaming and says tell me i ask you by the gods what you were saying just now is it a vice to suffer shipwreck does it participate in vice will you not take up a stick and lay it on his head what have we to do with you man we are perishing and you come to mock us but if caesar send for you to answer a charge do you remember the distinction if when you are going in pale and trembling a person should come up to you and say why do you tremble man what is the matter about which you are engaged does caesar who sits within give virtue and vice to those who go in to him you reply why do you also mock me and add to my present sorrows still tell me philosopher tell me why you tremble is it not death of which you run the risk or a prison or pain of the body or banishment or disgrace what else is there is ther
e any vice or anything which partakes of vice what then did you use to say of these things what have you to do with me man my own evils are enough for me and you say right your own evils are enough for you your baseness your cowardice your boasting which you showed when you sat in the school why did you decorate yourself with what belonged to others why did you call yourself a stoic  observe yourselves thus in your actions and you will find to what sect you belong you will find that most of you are epicureans a few peripatetics and those feeble for wherein will you show that you really consider virtue equal to everything else or even superior but show me a stoic if you can where or how but you can show me an endless number who utter small arguments of the stoics for do the same persons repeat the epicurean opinions any worse and the peripatetic do they not handle them also with equal accuracy who then is a stoic as we call a statue phidiac which is fashioned according to the art of phidias so show me a man wh
o is fashioned according to the doctrines which he utters show me a man who is sick and happy in danger and happy dying and happy in exile and happy in disgrace and happy show him i desire by the gods to see a stoic you cannot show me one fashioned so but show me at least one who is forming who has shown a tendency to be a stoic do me this favor do not grudge an old man seeing a sight which i have not seen yet do you think that you must show me the zeus of phidias or the athena a work of ivory and gold let any of you show me a human soul ready to think as god does and not to blame either god or man ready not to be disappointed about anything not to consider himself damaged by anything not to be angry not to be envious not to be jealous and why should i not say it direct desirous from a man to become a god and in this poor mortal body thinking of his fellowship with zeus show me the man but you cannot why then do you delude yourselves and cheat others and why do you put on a guise which does not belong to you 
and walk about being thieves and pilferers of these names and things which do not belong to you  and now i am your teacher and you are instructed in my school and i have this purpose to make you free from restraint compulsion hindrance to make you free prosperous happy looking to god in everything small and great and you are here to learn and practice these things why then do you not finish the work if you also have such a purpose as you ought to have and if i in addition to the purpose also have such qualification as i ought to have what is that which is wanting when i see an artificer and material lying by him i expect the work here then is the artificer here the material what is it that we want is not the thing one that can be taught it is is it not then in our power the only thing of all that is in our power neither wealth is in our power nor health nor reputation nor in a word anything else except the right use of appearances this right use is by nature free from restraint this alone is free from impedim
ent why then do you not finish the work tell me the reason for it is either through my fault that you do not finish it or through your own fault or through the nature of the thing the thing itself is possible and the only thing in our power it remains then that the fault is either in me or in you or what is nearer the truth in both well then are you willing that we begin at last to bring such a purpose into this school and to take no notice of the past let us only make a beginning trust to me and you will see  xx against the epicureans and academics the propositions which are true and evident are of necessity used even by those who contradict them and a man might perhaps consider it to be the greatest proof of a thing being evident that it is found to be necessary even for him who denies it to make use of it at the same time for instance if a man should deny that there is anything universally true it is plain that he must make the contradictory negation that nothing is universally true what wretch do you not 
admit even this for what else is this than to affirm that whatever is universally affirmed is false again if a man should come forward and say know that there is nothing that can be known but all things are incapable of sure evidence or if another say believe me and you will be the better for it that a man ought not to believe anything or again if another should say learn from me man that it is not possible to learn anything i tell you this and will teach you if you choose now in what respect do these differ from those whom shall i name those who call themselves academics men agree with us that no man agrees with another believe us that no man believes anybody  thus epicurus also when he designs to destroy the natural fellowship of mankind at the same time makes use of that which he destroys for what does he say be not deceived men nor be led astray nor be mistaken there is no natural fellowship among rational animals believe me but those who say otherwise deceive you and seduce you by false reasonswhat is th
is to you permit us to be deceived will you fare worse if all the rest of us are persuaded that there is a natural fellowship among us and that it ought by all means to be preserved nay it will be much better and safer for you man why do you trouble yourself about us why do you keep awake for us why do you light your lamp why do you rise early why do you write so many books that no one of us may be deceived about the gods and believe that they take care of men or that no one may suppose the nature of good to be other than pleasure for if this is so lie down and sleep and lead the life of a worm of which you judged yourself worthy eat and drink and enjoy women and ease yourself and snore and what is it to you how the rest shall think about these things whether right or wrong for what have we to do with you you take care of sheep because they supply us with wool and milk and last of all with their flesh would it not be a desirable thing if men could be lulled and enchanted by the stoics and sleep and present th
emselves to you and to those like you to be shorn and milked for this you ought to say to your brother epicureans but ought you not to conceal it from others and particularly before everything to persuade them that we are by nature adapted for fellowship that temperance is a good thing in order that all things may be secured for you or ought we to maintain this fellowship with some and not with others with whom then ought we to maintain it with such as on their part also maintain it or with such as violate this fellowship and who violate it more than you who establish such doctrines  what then was it that waked epicurus from his sleepiness and compelled him to write what he did write what else was it than that which is the strongest thing in men nature which draws a man to her own will though he be unwilling and complaining for since she says you think that there is no community among mankind write this opinion and leave it for others and break your sleep to do this and by your own practice condemn your own o
pinions shall we then say that orestes was agitated by the erinyes furies and roused from his deep sleep and did not more savage erinyes and pains rouse epicurus from his sleep and not allow him to rest but compelled him to make known his own evils as madness and wine did the galli the priests of cybele so strong and invincible is mans nature for how can a vine be moved not in the manner of a vine but in the manner of an olive tree or on the other hand how can an olive tree be moved not in the manner of an olive tree but in the manner of a vine it is impossible it cannot be conceived neither then is it possible for a man completely to lose the movements affects of a man and even those who are deprived of their genital members are not able to deprive themselves of mans desires thus epicurus also mutilated all the offices of a man and of a father of a family and of a citizen and of a friend but he did not mutilate human desires for he could not not more than the lazy academics can cast away or blind their own s
enses though they have tried with all their might to do it what a shame is this when a man has received from nature measures and rules for the knowing of truth and does not strive to add to these measures and rules and to improve them but just the contrary endeavors to take away and destroy whatever enables us to discern the truth  what say you philosopher piety and sanctity what do you think that they are if you like i will demonstrate that they are good things well demonstrate it that our citizens may be turned and honor the deity and may no longer be negligent about things of the highest value have you then the demonstrations i have and i am thankful since then you are well pleased with them hear the contrary that there are no gods and if there are they take no care of men nor is there any fellowship between us and them and that this piety and sanctity which is talked of among most men is the lying of boasters and sophists or certainly of legislators for the purpose of terrifying and checking wrongdoers we
ll done philosopher you have done something for our citizens you have brought back all the young men to contempt of things divine what then does not this satisfy you learn now that justice is nothing that modesty is folly that a father is nothing a son nothing well done philosopher persist persuade the young men that we may have more with the same opinions as you and who say the same as you from such principles as these have grown our well constituted states by these was sparta founded lycurgus fixed these opinions in the spartans by his laws and education that neither is the servile condition more base than honorable nor the condition of free men more honorable than base and that those who died at thermopylae died from these opinions and through what other opinions did the athenians leave their city then those who talk thus marry and beget children and employ themselves in public affairs and make themselves priests and interpreters of whom of gods who do not exist and they consult the pythian priestess that 
they may hear lies and they report the oracles to others monstrous impudence and imposture  man what are you doing are you refuting yourself every day and will you not give up these frigid attempts when you eat where do you carry your hand to to your mouth or to your eye when you wash yourself what do you go into do you ever call a pot a dish or a ladle a spit if i were a slave of any of these men even if i must be flayed by him daily i would rack him if he said boy throw some olive oil into the bath i would take pickle sauce and pour it down on his head what is this he would say an appearance was presented to me i swear by your genius which could not be distinguished from oil and was exactly like it here give me the barley drink tisane he says i would fill and carry him a dish of sharp sauce did i not ask for the barley drink yes mister this is the barley drink take it and smell take it and taste how do you know then if our senses deceive usif i had three or four fellowslaves of the same opinion i should for
ce him to hang himself through passion or to change his mind but now they mock us by using all the things which nature gives and in words destroying them  grateful indeed are men and modest who if they do nothing else are daily eating bread and yet are shameless enough to say we do not know if there is a demeter or her daughter persephone or a pluto not to mention that they are enjoying the night and the day the seasons of the year and the stars and the sea and the land and the cooperation of mankind and yet they are not moved in any degree by these things to turn their attention to them but they only seek to belch out their little problem matter for discussion and when they have exercised their stomach to go off to the bath but what they shall say and about what things or to what persons and what their hearers shall learn from this talk they care not even in the least degree nor do they care if any generous youth after hearing such talk should suffer any harm from it nor after he has suffered harm should los
e all the seeds of his generous nature nor if we should give an adulterer help towards being shameless in his acts nor if a public peculator should lay hold of some cunning excuse from these doctrines nor if another who neglects his parents should be confirmed in his audacity by this teachingwhat then in your opinion is good or bad this or thatwhy then should a man say any more in reply to such persons as these or give them any reason or listen to any reason from them or try to convince them by zeus one might much sooner expect to make catamites change their mind than those who are become so deaf and blind to their own evils  xxi of inconsistency some things men readily confess and other things they do not no one then will confess that he is a fool or without understanding but quite the contrary you will hear all men saying i wish that i had fortune equal to my understanding but men readily confess that they are timid and they say i am rather timid i confess but as to other respects you will not find me to be
 foolish a man will not readily confess that he is intemperate and that he is unjust he will not confess at all he will by no means confess that he is envious or a busybody most men will confess that they are compassionate what then is the reasonthe chief thing the ruling thing is inconsistency and confusion in the things which relate to good and evil but different men have different reasons and generally what they imagine to be base they do not confess at all but they suppose timidity to be a characteristic of a good disposition and compassion also but silliness to be the absolute characteristic of a slave and they do not at all admit confess the things which are offenses against society but in the case of most errors for this reason chiefly they are induced to confess them because they imagine that there is something involuntary in them as in timidity and compassion and if a man confess that he is in any respect intemperate he alleges love or passion as an excuse for what is involuntary but men do not imagi
ne injustice to be at all involuntary there is also in jealousy as they suppose something involuntary and for this reason they confess to jealousy also  living then among such men who are so confused so ignorant of what they say and of the evils which they have or have not and why they have them or how they shall be relieved of them i think it is worth the trouble for a man to watch constantly and to ask whether i also am one of them what imagination i have about myself how i conduct myself whether i conduct myself as a prudent man whether i conduct myself as a temperate man whether i ever say this that i have been taught to be prepared for everything that may happen have i the consciousness which a man who knows nothing ought to have that i know nothing do i go to my teacher as men go to oracles prepared to obey or do i like a snivelling boy go to my school to learn history and understand the books which i did not understand before and if it should happen so to explain them also to othersman you have had a f
ight in the house with a poor slave you have turned the family upside down you have frightened the neighbours and you come to me as if you were a wise man and you take your seat and judge how i have explained some word and how i have babbled whatever came into my head you come full of envy and humbled because you bring nothing from home and you sit during the discussion thinking of nothing else than how your father is disposed towards you and your brother what are they saying about me there now they think that i am improving and are saying he will return with all knowledge i wish i could learn everything before i return but much labor is necessary and no one sends me anything and the baths at nicopolis are dirty everything is bad at home and bad here  then they say no one gains any profit from the schoolwhy who comes to the school who comes for the purpose of being improved who comes to present his opinions to be purified who comes to learn what he is in want of why do you wonder then if you carry back from t
he school the very things which you bring into it for you come not to lay aside your principles or to correct them or to receive other principles in place of them by no means nor anything like it you rather look to this whether you possess already that for which you come you wish to prattle about theorems what then do you not become greater triflers do not your little theorems give you some opportunity of display you solve sophistical syllogisms do you not examine the assumptions of the syllogism named the liar do you not examine hypothetical syllogisms why then are you still vexed if you receive the things for which you come to the school yes but if my child die or my brother or if i must die or be racked what good will these things do mewell did you come for this for this do you sit by my side did you ever for this light your lamp or keep awake or when you went out to the walking place did you ever propose any appearance that had been presented to you instead of a syllogism and did you and your friends disc
uss it together where and when then you say theorems are useless to whom to such as make a bad use of them for eyesalves are not useless to those who use them as they ought and when they ought fomentations are not useless dumbbells are not useless but they are useless to some useful to others if you ask me now if syllogisms are useful i will tell you that they are useful and if you choose i will prove ithow then will they in any way be useful to me man did you ask if they are useful to you or did you ask generally let him who is suffering from dysentery ask me if vinegar is useful i will say that it is usefulwill it then be useful to mei will say no seek first for the discharge to be stopped and the ulcers to be closed and do you o men first cure the ulcers and stop the discharge be tranquil in your mind bring it free from distraction into the school and you will know what power reason has  xxii on friendship what a man applies himself to earnestly that he naturally loves do men then apply themselves earnestl
y to the things which are bad by no means well do they apply themselves to things which in no way concern themselves not to these either it remains then that they employ themselves earnestly only about things which are good and if they are earnestly employed about things they love such things also whoever then understands what is good can also know how to love but he who cannot distinguish good from bad and things which are neither good nor bad from both how can he possess the power of loving to love then is only in the power of the wise  how is this a man may say i am foolish and yet i love my childi am surprised indeed that you have begun by making the admission that you are foolish for what are you deficient in can you not make use of your senses do you not distinguish appearances do you not use food which is suitable for your body and clothing and habitation why then do you admit that you are foolish it is in truth because you are often disturbed by appearances and perplexed and their power of persuasion 
often conquers you and sometimes you think these things to be good and then the same things to be bad and lastly neither good nor bad and in short you grieve fear envy are disturbed you are changed this is the reason why you confess that you are foolish and are you not changeable in love but wealth and pleasure and in a word things themselves do you sometimes think them to be good and sometimes bad and do you not think the same men at one time to be good at another time bad and have you not at one time a friendly feeling towards them and at another time the feeling of an enemy and do you not at one time praise them and at another time blame them yes i have these feelings also well then do you think that he who has been deceived about a man is his friend certainly not and he who has selected a man as his friend and is of a changeable disposition has he good will towards him he has not and he who now abuses a man and afterwards admires him this man also has no good will to the other well then did you never see 
little dogs caressing and playing with one another so that you might say there is nothing more friendly but that you may know what friendship is throw a bit of flesh among them and you will learn throw between yourself and your son a little estate and you will know how soon he will wish to bury you and how soon you wish your son to die then you will change your tone and say what a son i have brought up he has long been wishing to bury me throw a smart girl between you and do you the old man love her and the young one will love her too if a little fame intervene or dangers it will be just the same you will utter the words of the father of admetus  life gives you pleasure and why not your father do you think that admetus did not love his own child when he was little that he was not in agony when the child had a fever that he did not often say i wish i had the fever instead of the child then when the test the thing came and was near see what words they utter were not eteocles and polynices from the same mother a
nd from the same father were they not brought up together had they not lived together drunk together slept together and often kissed one another so that if any man i think had seen them he would have ridiculed the philosophers for the paradoxes which they utter about friendship but when a quarrel rose between them about the royal power as between dogs about a bit of meat see what they say  polynices	where will you take your station before the towers eteocles	why do you ask me this polynices	i will place myself opposite and try to kill you eteocles	i also wish to do the same such are the wishes that they utter  for universally be not deceived every animal is attached to nothing so much as to its own interest whatever then appears to it an impediment to this interest whether this be a brother or a father or a child or beloved or lover it hates spurns curses for its nature is to love nothing so much as its own interest this is father and brother and kinsman and country and god when then the gods appear to us to 
be an impediment to this we abuse them and throw down their statues and burn their temples as alexander ordered the temples of aesculapius to be burned when his dear friend died  for this reason if a man put in the same place his interest sanctity goodness and country and parents and friends all these are secured but if he puts in one place his interest in another his friends and his country and his kinsmen and justice itself all these give way being borne down by the weight of interest for where the i and the mine are placed to that place of necessity the animal inclines if in the flesh there is the ruling power if in the will it is there and if it is in externals it is there if then i am there where my will is then only shall i be a friend such as i ought to be and son and father for this will be my interest to maintain the character of fidelity of modesty of patience of abstinence of active cooperation of observing my relations towards all but if i put myself in one place and honesty in another then the do
ctrine of epicurus becomes strong which asserts either that there is no honesty or it is that which opinion holds to be honest virtuous  it was through this ignorance that the athenians and the lacedaemonians quarrelled and the thebans with both and the great king quarrelled with hellas and the macedonians with both and the romans with the getae and still earlier the trojan war happened for these reasons alexander was the guest of menelaus and if any man had seen their friendly disposition he would not have believed anyone who said that they were not friends but there was cast between them as between dogs a bit of meat a handsome woman and about her war arose and now when you see brothers to be friends appearing to have one mind do not conclude from this anything about their friendship not even if they swear it and say that it is impossible for them to be separated from one another for the ruling principle of a bad man cannot be trusted it is insecure has no certain rule by which it is directed and is overpow
ered at different times by different appearances but examine not what other men examineif they are born of the same parents and brought up together and under the same pedagoguebut examine this only wherein they place their interest whether in externals or in the will if in externals do not name them friends no more than name them trustworthy or constant or brave or free do not name them even men if you have any judgment for that is not a principle of human nature which makes them bite one another and abuse one another and occupy deserted places or public places as if they were mountains and in the courts of justice display the acts of robbers nor yet that which makes them intemperate and adulterers and corrupters nor that which makes them do whatever else men do against one another through this one opinion only that of placing themselves and their interests in the things which are not within the power of their will but if you hear that in truth these men think the good to be only there where will is and where
 there is a right use of appearances no longer trouble yourself whether they are father or son or brothers or have associated a long time and are companions but when you have ascertained this only confidently declare that they are friends as you declare that they are faithful that they are just for where else is friendship than where there is fidelity and modesty where there is a communion of honest things and of nothing else  but you may say such a one treated me with regard so long and did he not love me how do you know slave if he did not regard you in the same way as he wipes his shoes with a sponge or as he takes care of his beast how do you know when you have ceased to be useful as a vessel he will not throw you away like a broken platter but this woman is my wife and we have lived together so long and how long did eriphyle live with amphiaraus and was the mother of children and of many but a necklace came between them and what is a necklace it is the opinion about such things that was the bestial princ
iple that was the thing which broke asunder the friendship between husband and wife that which did not allow the woman to be a wife nor the mother to be a mother and let every man among you who has seriously resolved either to be a friend himself or to have another for his friend cut out these opinions hate them drive them from his soul and thus first of all he will not reproach himself he will not be at variance with himself he will not change his mind he will not torture himself in the next place to another also who is like himself he will be altogether and completely a friend but he will bear with the man who is unlike himself he will be kind to him gentle ready to pardon on account of his ignorance on account of his being mistaken in things of the greatest importance but he will be harsh to no man being well convinced of platos doctrine that every mind is deprived of truth unwillingly if you cannot do this yet you can do in all other respects as friends dodrink together and lodge together and sail togethe
rand you may be born of the same parentsfor snakes also arebut neither will they be friends nor you so long as you retain these bestial and cursed opinions  xxiii on the power of speaking every man will read a book with more pleasure or even with more ease if it is written in fairer characters therefore every man will also listen more readily to what is spoken if it is signified by appropriate and becoming words we must not say then that there is no faculty of expression for this affirmation is the characteristic of an impious and also of a timid man of an impious man because he undervalues the gifts which come from god just as if he would take away the commodity of the power of vision or of hearing or of seeing has then god given you eyes to no purpose and to no purpose has he infused into them a spirit so strong and of such skillful contrivance as to reach a long way and to fashion the forms of things which are seen what messenger is so swift and vigilant and to no purpose has he made the interjacent atmosp
here so efficacious and elastic that the vision penetrates through the atmosphere which is in a manner moved and to no purpose has he made light without the presence of which there would be no use in any other thing  man be neither ungrateful for these gifts nor yet forget the things which are superior to them but indeed for the power of seeing and hearing and indeed for life itself and for the things which contribute to support it for the fruits which are dry and for wine and oil give thanks to god but remember that he has given you something else better than all these i mean the power of using them proving them and estimating the value of each for what is that which gives information about each of these powers what each of them is worth is it each faculty itself did you ever hear the faculty of vision saying anything about itself or the faculty of hearing or wheat or barley or a horse or a dog no but they are appointed as ministers and slaves to serve the faculty which has the power of making use of the app
earances of things and if you inquire what is the value of each thing of whom do you inquire who answers you how then can any other faculty be more powerful than this which uses the rest as ministers and itself proves each and pronounces about them for which of them knows what itself is and what is its own value which of them knows when it ought to employ itself and when not what faculty is it which opens and closes the eyes and turns them away from objects to which it ought not to apply them and does apply them to other objects is it the faculty of vision no but it is the faculty of the will what is that faculty which closes and opens the ears what is that by which they are curious and inquisitive or on the contrary unmoved by what is said is it the faculty of hearing it is no other than the faculty of the will will this faculty then seeing that it is amidst all the other faculties which are blind and dumb and unable to see anything else except the very acts for which they are appointed in order to minister 
to this faculty and serve it but this faculty alone sees sharp and sees what is the value of each of the rest will this faculty declare to us that anything else is the best or that itself is and what else does the eye do when it is opened than see but whether we ought to look on the wife of a certain person and in what manner who tells us the faculty of the will and whether we ought to believe what is said or not to believe it and if we do believe whether we ought to be moved by it or not who tells us is it not the faculty of the will but this faculty of speaking and of ornamenting words if there is indeed any such peculiar faculty what else does it do when there happens to be discourse about a thing than to ornament the words and arrange them as hairdressers do the hair but whether it is better to speak or to be silent and better to speak in this way or that way and whether this is becoming or not becoming and the season for each and the use what else tells us than the faculty of the will would you have it t
hen to come forward and condemn itself  what then it the will says if the fact is so can that which ministers be superior to that to which it ministers can the horse be superior to the rider or the dog to the huntsman or the instrument to the musician or the servants to the king what is that which makes use of the rest the will what takes care of all the will what destroys the whole man at one time by hunger at another time by hanging and at another time by a precipice the will then is anything stronger in men than this and how is it possible that the things which are subject to restraint are stronger than that which is not what things are naturally formed to hinder the faculty of vision both will and things which do not depend on the faculty of the will it is the same with the faculty of hearing with the faculty of speaking in like manner but what has a natural power of hindering the will nothing which is independent of the will but only the will itself when it is perverted therefore this the will is alone v
ice or alone virtue  then being so great a faculty and set over all the rest let it the will come forward and tell us that the most excellent of all things is the flesh not even if the flesh itself declared that it is the most excellent would any person bear that it should say this but what is it epicurus which pronounces this which wrote about the end purpose of our being which wrote on the nature of things which wrote about the canon rule of truth which led you to wear a beard which wrote when it was dying that it was spending the last and a happy day was this the flesh or the will then do you admit that you possess anything superior to this the will and are you not mad are you in fact so blind and deaf  what then does any man despise the other faculties i hope not does any man say that there is no use or excellence in the speaking faculty i hope not that would be foolish impious ungrateful towards god but a man renders to each thing its due value for there is some use even in an ass but not so much as in a
n ox there is also use in a dog but not so much as in a slave there is also some use in a slave but not so much as in citizens there is also some use in citizens but not so much as in magistrates not indeed because some things are superior must we undervalue the use which other things have there is a certain value in the power of speaking but it is not so great as the power of the will when then i speak thus let no man think that i ask you to neglect the power of speaking for neither do i ask you to neglect the eyes nor the ears nor the hands nor the feet nor clothing nor shoes but if you ask me what then is the most excellent of all things what must i say i cannot say the power of speaking but the power of the will when it is right ὀρθὴ for it is this which uses the other the power of speaking and all the other faculties both small and great for when this faculty of the will is set right a man who is not good becomes good but when it fails a man becomes bad it is through this that we are unfortunate that we 
are fortunate that we blame one another are pleased with one another in a word it is this which if we neglect it makes unhappiness and if we carefully look after it makes happiness  but to take away the faculty of speaking and to say that there is no such faculty in reality is the act not only of an ungrateful man towards those who gave it but also of a cowardly man for such a person seems to me to fear if there is any faculty of this kind that we shall not be able to despise it such also are those who say that there is no difference between beauty and ugliness then it would happen that a man would be affected in the same way if he saw thersites and if he saw achilles in the same way if he saw helen and any other woman but these are foolish and clownish notions and the notions of men who know not the nature of each thing but are afraid if a man shall see the difference that he shall immediately be seized and carried off vanquished but this is the great matter to leave to each thing the power faculty which it 
has and leaving to it this power to see what is the worth of the power and to learn what is the most excellent of all things and to pursue this always to be diligent about this considering all other things of secondary value compared with this but yet as far as we can not neglecting all those other things for we must take care of the eyes also not as if they were the most excellent thing but we must take care of them on account of the most excellent thing because it will not be in its true natural condition if it does not rightly use the other faculties and prefer some things to others  what then is usually done men generally act as a traveller would do on his way to his own country when he enters a good inn and being pleased with it should remain there man you have forgotten your purpose you were not travelling to this inn but you were passing through it but this is a pleasant inn and how many other inns are pleasant and how many meadows are pleasant yet only for passing through but your purpose is this to r
eturn to your country to relieve your kinsmen of anxiety to discharge the duties of a citizen to marry to beget children to fill the usual magistracies for you are not come to select more pleasant places but to live in these where you were born and of which you were made a citizen something of the kind takes place in the matter which we are considering since by the aid of speech and such communication as you receive here you must advance to perfection and purge your will and correct the faculty which makes use of the appearances of things and since it is necessary also for the teaching delivery of theorems to be effected by a certain mode of expression and with a certain variety and sharpness some persons captivated by these very things abide in them one captivated by the expression another by syllogisms another again by sophisms and still another by some other inn πανδοκείου of the kind and there they stay and waste away as if they were among sirens  man your purpose business was to make yourself capable of 
using comformably to nature the appearances presented to you in your desires not to be frustrated in your aversion from things not to fall into that which you would avoid never to have no luck as one may say nor ever to have bad luck to be free not hindered not compelled conforming yourself to the administration of zeus obeying it well satisfied with this blaming no one charging no one with fault able from your whole soul to utter these verses  lead me o zeus and thou too destiny then having this purpose before you if some little form of expression pleases you if some theorems please you do you abide among them and choose to dwell there forgetting the things at home and do you say these things are fine who says that they are not fine but only as being a way home as inns are for what hinders you from being an unfortunate man even if you speak like demosthenes and what prevents you if you can resolve syllogisms like chrysippus from being wretched from sorrowing from envying in a word from being disturbed from b
eing unhappy nothing you see then that these were inns worth nothing and that the purpose before you was something else when i speak thus to some persons they think that i am rejecting care about speaking or care about theorems but i am not rejecting this care but i am rejecting the abiding about these things incessantly and putting our hopes in them if a man by this teaching does harm to those who listen to him reckon me too among those who do this harm for i am not able when i see one thing which is most excellent and supreme to say that another is so in order to please you  xxiv to or against a person who was one of those who were not valued esteemed by him a certain person said to him epictetus frequently i desired to hear you and came to you and you never gave me any answer and now if it is possible i entreat you to say something to me do you think said epictetus that as there is an art in anything else so there is also an art in speaking and that he who has the art will speak skillfully and he who has n
ot will speak unskillfully i do think so he then who by speaking receives benefit himself and is able to benefit others will speak skillfully but he who is rather damaged by speaking and does damage to others will he be unskilled in this art of speaking and you may find that some are damaged and others benefited by speaking and are all who hear benefited by what they hear or will you find that among them also some are benefited and some damaged there are both among these also he said in this case also then those who hear skillfully are benefited and those who hear unskillfully are damaged he admitted this is there then a skill in hearing also as there is in speaking it seems so if you choose consider the matter in this way also the practice of music to whom does it belong to a musician and the proper making of a statue to whom do you think that it belongs to a statuary and the looking at a statue skillfully does this appear to you to require the aid of no art this also requires the aid of art then if speaking
 properly is the business of the skillful man do you see that to hear also with benefit is the business of the skillful man now as to speaking and hearing perfectly and usefully let us for the present if you please say no more for both of us are a long way from everything of the kind but i think that every man will allow this that he who is going to hear philosophers requires some amount of practice in hearing is it not so  tell me then about what i should talk to you about what matter are you able to listen about good and evil good and evil in what in a horse no well in an ox no what then in a man yes do we know then what a man is what the notion is which we have of him or have we our ears in any degree practiced about this matter but do you understand what nature is or can you even in any degree understand me when i say i shall use demonstration to you how do you understand this very thing what demonstration is or how anything is demonstrated or by what means or what things are like demonstration but are no
t demonstration do you know what is true or what is false what is consequent on a thing what is repugnant to a thing or not consistent or inconsistent but must i excite you to philosophy and how shall i show to you the repugnance in the opinions of most men through which they differ about things good and evil and about things which are profitable and unprofitable when you know not this very thing what repugnance contradiction is show me then what i shall accomplish by discoursing with youexcite my inclination to do this as the grass which is suitable when it is presented to a sheep moves its inclination to eat but if you present to it a stone or bread it will not be moved to eat so there are in us certain natural inclinations also to speak when the hearer shall appear to be somebody when he himself shall excite us but when he shall sit by us like a stone or like grass how can he excite a mans desire to speak does the vine say to the husbandman take care of me no but the vine by showing in itself that it will 
be profitable to the husbandman if he does take care of it invites him to exercise care when children are attractive and lively whom do they not invite to play with them and crawl with them and lisp with them but who is eager to play with an ass or to bray with it for though it is small it is still a little ass  why then do you say nothing to me i can only say this to you that he who knows not who he is and for what purpose he exists and what is this world and with whom he is associated and what things are the good and the bad and the beautiful and the ugly and who neither understands discourse nor demonstration nor what is true nor what is false and who is not able to distinguish them will neither desire according to nature nor turn away nor move towards nor intend to act nor assent nor dissent nor suspend his judgment to say all in a few words he will go about dumb and blind thinking that he is somebody but being nobody is this so now for the first time is it not the fact that ever since the human race exis
ted all errors and misfortunes have arisen through this ignorance why did agamemnon and achilles quarrel with one another was it not through not knowing what things are profitable and not profitable does not the one say it is profitable to restore chryseis to her father and does not the other say that it is not profitable does not the one say that he ought to take the prize of another and does not the other say that he ought not did they not for these reasons forget both who they were and for what purpose they had come there oh man for what purpose did you come to gain mistresses or to fight to fight with whom the trojans or the hellenes with the trojans do you then leave hector alone and draw your sword against your own king and do you most excellent sir neglect the duties of the king you who are the peoples guardian and have such cares and are you quarrelling about a little girl with the most warlike of your allies whom you ought by every means to take care of and protect and do you become worse than inferi
or to a well behaved priest who treats you these fine gladiators with all respect do you see what kind of things ignorance of what is profitable does  but i also am rich are you then richer than agamemnon but i am also handsome are you then more handsome than achilles but i have also beautiful hair but had not achilles more beautiful hair and gold colored and he did not comb it elegantly nor dress it but i am also strong can you then lift so great a stone as hector or ajax but i am also of noble birth are you the son of a goddess mother are you the son of a father sprung from zeus what good then do these things do to him when he sits and weeps for a girl but i am an orator and was he not do you not see how he handled the most skillful of the hellenes in oratory odysseus and phoenix how he stopped their mouths  this is all that i have to say to you and i say even this not willingly why because you have not roused me for what must i look to in order to be roused as men who are expert in riding are roused by gen
erous horses must i look to your body you treat it disgracefully to your dress that is luxurious to your behavior to your look that is the same as nothing when you would listen to a philosopher do not say to him you tell me nothing but only show yourself worthy of hearing or fit for hearing and you will see how you will move the speaker  xxv that logic is necessary when one of those who were present said persuade me that logic is necessary he replied do you wish me to prove this to you the answer was yes then i must use a demonstrative form of speechthis was grantedhow then will you know if i am cheating you by my argument the man was silent do you see said epictetus that you yourself are admitting that logic is necessary if without it you cannot know so much as this whether logic is necessary or not necessary  xxvi what is the property of error every error comprehends contradiction for since he who errs does not wish to err but to be right it is plain that he does not do what he wishes for what does the thie
f wish to do that which is for his own interest if then the theft is not for his interest he does not do that which he wishes but every rational soul is by nature offended at contradiction and so long as it does not understand this contradiction it is not hindered from doing contradictory things but when it does understand the contradiction it must of necessity avoid the contradiction and avoid it as much as a man must dissent from the false when he sees that a thing is false but so long as this falsehood does not appear to him he assents to it as to truth  he then is strong in argument and has the faculty of exhorting and confuting who is able to show to each man the contradiction through which he errs and clearly to prove how he does not do that which he wishes and does that which he does not wish for if anyone shall show this a man will himself withdraw from that which he does but so long as you do not show this do not be surprised if a man persists in his practice for having the appearance of doing right 
he does what he does for this reason socrates also trusting to this power used to say i am used to call no other witness of what i say but i am always satisfied with him with whom i am discussing and i ask him to give his opinion and call him as a witness and though he is only one he is sufficient in the place of all for socrates knew by what the rational soul is moved just like a pair of scales and then it must incline whether it chooses or not show the rational governing faculty a contradiction and it will withdraw from it but if you do not show it rather blame yourself than him who is not persuaded  book iii i of finery in dress a certain young man a rhetorician came to see epictetus with his hair dressed more carefully than was usual and his attire in an ornamental style whereupon epictetus said tell me if you do not think that some dogs are beautiful and some horses and so of all other animals i do think so the youth replied are not then some men also beautiful and others ugly certainly do we then for th
e same reason call each of them in the same kind beautiful or each beautiful for something peculiar and you will judge of this matter thus since we see a dog naturally formed for one thing and a horse for another and for another still as an example a nightingale we may generally and not improperly declare each of them to be beautiful then when it is most excellent according to its nature but since the nature of each is different each of them seems to me to be beautiful in a different way is it not so he admitted that it was that then which makes a dog beautiful makes a horse ugly and that which makes a horse beautiful makes a dog ugly if it is true that their natures are different it seems to be so for i think that what makes a pancratiast beautiful makes a wrestler to be not good and a runner to be most ridiculous and he who is beautiful for the pentathlon is very ugly for wrestling it is so said he what then makes a man beautiful is it that which in its kind makes both a dog and a horse beautiful it is he s
aid what then makes a dog beautiful the possession of the excellence of a dog and what makes a horse beautiful the possession of the excellence of a horse what then makes a man beautiful is it not the possession of the excellence of a man and do you then if you wish to be beautiful young man labor at this the acquisition of human excellence but what is this observe whom you yourself praise when you praise many persons without partiality do you praise the just or the unjust the just whether do you praise the moderate or the immoderate the moderate and the temperate or the intemperate the temperate if then you make yourself such a person you will know that you will make yourself beautiful but so long as you neglect these things you must be ugly αἰσχρόν even though you contrive all you can to appear beautiful further i do not know what to say to you for if i say to you what i think i shall offend you and you will perhaps leave the school and not return to it and if i do not say what i think see how i shall be ac
ting if you come to me to be improved and i shall not improve you at all and if you come to me as to a philosopher and i shall say nothing to you as a philosopher and how cruel it is to you to leave you uncorrected if at any time afterwards you shall acquire sense you will with good reason blame me and say what did epictetus observe in me that when he saw me in such a plight coming to him in such a scandalous condition he neglected me and never said a word did he so much despair of me was i not young was i not able to listen to reason and how many other young men at this age commit many like errors i hear that a certain polemon from being a most dissolute youth underwent such a great change well suppose that he did not think that i should be a polemon yet he might have set my hair right he might have stripped off my decorations he might have stopped me from plucking the hair out of my body but when he saw me dressed likewhat shall i sayhe kept silent i do not say like what but you will say when you come to yo
ur senses and shall know what it is and what persons use such a dress  if you bring this charge against me hereafter what defense shall i make why shall i say that the man will not be persuaded by me was laius persuaded by apollo did he not go away and get drunk and show no care for the oracle well then for this reason did apollo refuse to tell him the truth i indeed do not know whether you will be persuaded by me or not but apollo knew most certainly that laius would not be persuaded and yet he spoke but why did he speak i say in reply but why is he apollo and why does he deliver oracles and why has he fixed himself in this place as a prophet and source of truth and for the inhabitants of the world to resort to him and why are the words know yourself written in front of the temple though no person takes any notice of them  did socrates persuade all his hearers to take care of themselves not the thousandth part but however after he had been placed in this position by the deity as he himself says he never left
 it but what does he say even to his judges if you acquit me on these conditions that i no longer do that which i do now i will not consent and i will not desist but i will go up both to young and to old and to speak plainly to every man whom i meet and i will ask the questions which i ask now and most particularly will i do this to you my fellow citizens because you are more nearly related to meare you so curious socrates and such a busybody and how does it concern you how we act and what is it that you say being of the same community and of the same kin you neglect yourself and show yourself a bad citizen to the state and a bad kinsman to your kinsmen and a bad neighbour to your neighbours who then are youhere it is a great thing to say i am he whose duty it is to take care of men for it is not every little heifer which dares to resist a lion but if the bull comes up and resists him say to the bull if you choose and who are you and what business have you here  man in every kind there is produced something w
hich excels in oxen in dogs in bees in horses do not then say to that which excels who then are you if you do it will find a voice in some way and say i am such a thing as the purple in a garment do not expect me to be like the others or blame my nature that it has made me different from the rest of men  what then am i such a man certainly not and are you such a man as can listen to the truth i wish you were but however since in a manner i have been condemned to wear a white beard and a cloak and you come to me as to a philosopher i will not treat you in a cruel way nor yet as if i despaired of you but i will say young man whom do you wish to make beautiful in the first place know who you are and then adorn yourself appropriately you are a human being and this is a mortal animal which has the power of using appearances rationally but what is meant by rationally conformably to nature and completely what then do you possess which is peculiar is it the animal part no is it the condition of mortality no is it the
 power of using appearances no you possess the rational faculty as a peculiar thing adorn and beautify this but leave your hair to him who made it as he chose come what other appellations have you are you man or woman man adorn yourself then as man not as woman woman is naturally smooth and delicate and if she has much hair on her body she is a monster and is exhibited at rome among monsters and in a man it is monstrous not to have hair and if he has no hair he is a monster but if he cuts off his hairs and plucks them out what shall we do with him where shall we exhibit him and under what name shall we show him i will exhibit to you a man who chooses to be a woman rather than a man what a terrible sight there is no man who will not wonder at such a notice indeed i think that the men who pluck out their hairs do what they do without knowing what they do man what fault have you to find with your nature that it made you a man what then was it fit that nature should make all human creatures women and what advanta
ge in that case would you have had in being adorned for whom would you have adorned yourself if all human creatures were women but you are not pleased with the matter set to work then upon the whole business take awaywhat is its namethat which is the cause of the hairs make yourself a woman in all respects that we may not be mistaken do not make one half man and the other half woman whom do you wish to please the women please them as a man well but they like smooth men will you not hang yourself and if women took delight in catamites would you become one is this your business were you born for this purpose that dissolute women should delight in you shall we make such a one as you a citizen of corinth and perchance a prefect of the city or chief of the youth or general or superintendent of the games well and when you have taken a wife do you intend to have your hairs plucked out to please whom and for what purpose and when you have begotten children will you introduce them also into the state with the habit of
 plucking their hairs a beautiful citizen and senator and rhetorician we ought to pray that such young men be born among us and brought up  do not so i entreat you by the gods young man but when you have once heard these words go away and say to yourself epictetus has not said this to me for how could he but some propitious god through him for it would never have come into his thoughts to say this since he is not accustomed to talk thus with any person come then let us obey god that we may not be subject to his anger you say no but i say if a crow by his croaking signifies anything to you it is not the crow which signifies but god through the crow and if he signifies anything through a human voice will he not cause the man to say this to you that you may know the power of the divinity that he signifies to some in this way and to others in that way and concerning the greatest things and the chief he signifies through the noblest messenger what else is it which the poet says  for we ourselves have warned him an
d have sent hermes the careful watcher argus slayer the husband not to kill nor wed the wife was hermes going to descend from heaven to say this to him aegisthus and now the gods say this to you and send the messenger the slayer of argus to warn you not to pervert that which is well arranged nor to busy yourself about it but to allow a man to be a man and a woman to be a woman a beautiful man to be as a beautiful man and an ugly man as an ugly man for you are not flesh and hair but you are will προαίρεσις and if your will is beautiful then you will be beautiful but up to the present time i dare not tell you that you are ugly for i think that you are readier to hear anything than this but see what socrates says to the most beautiful and blooming of men alcibiades try then to be beautiful what does he say to him dress your hair and pluck the hairs from your legs nothing of that kind but adorn your will take away bad opinions how with the body leave it as it is by nature another has looked after these things ent
rust them to him what then must a man be uncleaned certainly not but what you are and are made by nature cleanse this a man should be cleanly as a man a woman as a woman a child as a child you say no but let us also pluck out the lions mane that he may not be uncleaned and the cocks comb for he also ought to be cleaned granted but as a cock and the lion as a lion and the hunting dog as a hunting dog  ii in what a man ought to be exercised who has made proficiency and that we neglect the chief things there are three things topics τόποι in which a man ought to exercise himself who would be wise and good the first concerns the desires and the aversions that a man may not fail to get what he desires and that he may not fall into that which he does not desire the second concerns the movements towards an object and the movements from an object and generally in doing what a man ought to do that he may act according to order to reason and not carelessly the third thing concerns freedom from deception and rashness in 
judgment and generally it concerns the assents συγκαταθέσεις of these topics the chief and the most urgent is that which relates to the affects τὰ πάθη perturbations for an affect is produced in no other way than by a failing to obtain that which a man desires or falling into that which a man would wish to avoid this is that which brings in perturbations disorders bad fortune misfortunes sorrows lamentations and envy that which makes men envious and jealous and by these causes we are unable even to listen to the precepts of reason the second topic concerns the duties of a man for i ought not to be free from affects ἀπαθῆ like a statue but i ought to maintain the relations σχέσεις natural and acquired as a pious man as a son as a father as a citizen  the third topic is that which immediately concerns those who are making proficiency that which concerns the security of the other two so that not even in sleep any appearance unexamined may surprise us nor in intoxication nor in melancholy this it may be said is a
bove our power but the present philosophers neglecting the first topic and the second the affects and duties employ themselves on the third using sophistical arguments μεταπίπτοντας making conclusions from questioning employing hypotheses lying for a man must as it is said when employed on these matters take care that he is not deceived who must the wise and good man this then is all that is wanting to you have you successfully worked out the rest are you free from deception in the matter of money if you see a beautiful girl do you resist the appearance if your neighbour obtains an estate by will are you not vexed now is there nothing else wanting to you except unchangeable firmness of mind ἀμεταπτωσία wretch you hear these very things with fear and anxiety that some person may despise you and with inquiries about what any person may say about you and if a man come and tell you that in a certain conversation in which the question was who is the best philosopher a man who was present said that a certain person
 was the chief philosopher your little soul which was only a fingers length stretches out to two cubits but if another who is present says you are mistaken it is not worthwhile to listen to a certain person for what does he know he has only the first principles and no more then you are confounded you grow pale you cry out immediately i will show him who i am that i am a great philosopher it is seen by these very things why do you wish to show it by others do you not know that diogenes pointed out one of the sophists in this way by stretching out his middle finger and then when the man was wild with rage this he said is the certain person i have pointed him out to you for a man is not shown by the finger as a stone or a piece of wood but when any person shows the mans principles then he shows him as a man  let us look at your principles also for is it not plain that you value not at all your own will προαίρεσις but you look externally to things which are independent of your will for instance what will a certai
n person say and what will people think of you will you be considered a man of learning have you read chrysippus or antipater for if you have read archedemus also you have everything that you can desire why are you still uneasy lest you should not show us who you are would you let me tell you what manner of man you have shown us that you are you have exhibited yourself to us as a mean fellow querulous passionate cowardly finding fault with everything blaming everybody never quiet vain this is what you have exhibited to us go away now and read archedemus then if a mouse should leap down and make a noise you are a dead man for such a death awaits you as it didwhat was the mans namecrinis and he too was proud because he understood archedemus  wretch will you not dismiss these things that do not concern you at all these things are suitable to those who are able to learn them without perturbation to those who can say i am not subject to anger to grief to envy i am not hindered i am not restrained what remains for 
me i have leisure i am tranquil let us see how we must deal with sophistical arguments let us see how when a man has accepted a hypothesis he shall not be led away to anything absurd to them such things belong to those who are happy it is appropriate to light a fire to dine if they choose both to sing and to dance but when the vessel is sinking you come to me and hoist the sails  iii what is the matter on which a good man should be employed and in what we ought chiefly to practice ourselves the material for the wise and good man is his own ruling faculty and the body is the material for the physician and the aliptes the man who oils persons the land is the matter for the husbandman the business of the wise and good man is to use appearances conformably to nature and as it is the nature of every soul to assent to the truth to dissent from the false and to remain in suspense as to that which is uncertain so it is its nature to be moved towards the desire of the good and to aversion from the evil and with respec
t to that which is neither good nor bad it feels indifferent for as the moneychanger banker is not allowed to reject caesars coin nor the seller of herbs but if you show the coin whether he chooses or not he must give up what is sold for the coin so it is also in the matter of the soul when the good appears it immediately attracts to itself the evil repels from itself but the soul will never reject the manifest appearance of the good any more than persons will reject caesars coin on this principle depends every movement both of man and god  for this reason the good is preferred to every intimate relationship obligation there is no intimate relationship between me and my father but there is between me and the good are you so hardhearted yes for such is my nature and this is the coin which god has given me for this reason if the good is something different from the beautiful and the just both father is gone neglected and brother and country and everything but shall i overlook my own good in order that you may h
ave it and shall i give it up to you why i am your father but you are not my good i am your brother but you are not my good but if we place the good in a right determination of the will the very observance of the relations of life is good and accordingly he who gives up any external things obtains that which is good your father takes away your property but he does not injure you your brother will have the greater part of the estate in land let him have as much as he chooses will he then have a greater share of modesty of fidelity of brotherly affection for who will eject you from this possession not even zeus for neither has he chosen to do so but he has made this in my own power and he has given it to me just as he possessed it himself free from hindrance compulsion and impediment when then the coin which another uses is a different coin if a man presents this coin he receives that which is sold for it suppose that there comes into the province a thievish proconsul what coin does he use silver coin show it t
o him and carry off what you please suppose one comes who is an adulterer what coin does he use little girls take a man says the coin and sell me the small thing give says the seller and buy what you want another is eager to possess boys give him the coin and receive what you wish another is fond of hunting give him a fine nag or a dog though he groans and laments he will sell for it that which you want for another compels him from within he who has fixed determined this coin  against or with respect to this kind of thing chiefly a man should exercise himself as soon as you go out in the morning examine every man whom you see every man whom you hear answer as to a question what have you seen a handsome man or woman apply the rule is this independent of the will or dependent independent take it away what have you seen a man lamenting over the death of a child apply the rule death is a thing independent of the will take it away has the proconsul met you apply the rule what kind of thing is a proconsuls office i
ndependent of the will or dependent on it independent take this away also it does not stand examination cast it away it is nothing to you  if we practiced this and exercised ourselves in it daily from morning to night something indeed would be done but now we are forthwith caught half asleep by every appearance and it is only if ever that in the school we are roused a little then when we go out if we see a man lamenting we say he is undone if we see a consul we say he is happy if we see an exiled man we say he is miserable if we see a poor man we say he is wretched he has nothing to eat  we ought then to eradicate these bad opinions and to this end we should direct all our efforts for what is weeping and lamenting opinion what is bad fortune opinion what is civil sedition what is divided opinion what is blame what is accusation what is impiety what is trifling all these things are opinions and nothing more and opinions about things independent of the will as if they were good and bad let a man transfer these 
opinions to things dependent on the will and i engage for him that he will be firm and constant whatever may be the state of things around him such as is a dish of water such is the soul such as is the ray of light which falls on the water such are the appearances when the water is moved the ray also seems to be moved yet it is not moved and when then a man is seized with giddiness it is not the arts and the virtues which are confounded but the spirit the nervous power on which they are impressed but if the spirit be restored to its settled state those things also are restored  iv against a person who showed his partisanship in an unseemly way in a theatre the governor of epirus having shown his favor to an actor in an unseemly way and being publicly blamed on this account and afterwards having reported to epictetus that he was blamed and that he was vexed at those who blamed him epictetus said what harm have they been doing these men also were acting as partisans as you were doing the governor replied does t
hen any person show his partisanship in this way when they see you said epictetus who are their governor a friend of caesar and his deputy showing partisanship in this way was it not to be expected that they also should show their partisanship in the same way for if it is not right to show partisanship in this way do not do so yourself and if it is right why are you angry if they followed your example for whom have the many to imitate except you who are their superiors to whose example should they look when they go to the theatre except yours see how the deputy of caesar looks on he has cried out and i too then will cry out he springs up from his seat and i will spring up his slaves sit in various parts of the theatre and call out i have no slaves but i will myself cry out as much as i can and as loud as all of them together you ought then to know when you enter the theatre that you enter as a rule and example to the rest how they ought to look at the acting why then did they blame you because every man hates
 that which is a hindrance to him they wished one person to be crowned you wished another they were a hindrance to you and you were a hindrance to them you were found to be the stronger and they did what they could they blamed that which hindered them what then would you have that you should do what you please and they should not even say what they please and what is the wonder do not the husbandmen abuse zeus when they are hindered by him do not the sailors abuse him do they ever cease abusing caesar what then does not zeus know is not what is said reported to caesar what then does he do he knows that if he punished all who abuse him he would have nobody to rule over what then when you enter the theatre you ought to say not let sophron some actor be crowned but you ought to say this come let me maintain my will in this matter so that it shall be conformable to nature no man is dearer to me than myself it would be ridiculous then for me to be hurt injured in order that another who is an actor may be crowned w
hom then do i wish to gain the prize why the actor who does gain the prize and so he will always gain the prize whom i wish to gain it but i wish sophron to be crowned celebrate as many games as you choose in your own house nemean pythian isthmian olympian and proclaim him victor but in public do not claim more than your due nor attempt to appropriate to yourself what belongs to all if you do not consent to this bear being abused for when you do the same as the many you put yourself on the same level with them  v against those who on account of sickness go away home i am sick here said one of the pupils and i wish to return home at home i suppose you were free from sickness do you not consider whether you are doing anything here which may be useful to the exercise of your will that it may be corrected for if you are doing nothing towards this end it was to no purpose that you came go away look after your affairs at home for if your ruling power cannot be maintained in a state conformable to nature it is possi
ble that your land can that you will be able to increase your money you will take care of your father in his old age frequent the public place hold magisterial office being bad you will do badly anything else that you have to do but if you understand yourself and know that you are casting away certain bad opinions and adopting others in their place and if you have changed your state of life from things which are not within your will to things which are within your will and if you ever say alas you are not saying what you say on account of your father or your brother but on account of yourself do you still allege your sickness do you not know that both disease and death must surprise us while we are doing something the husbandman while he is tilling the ground the sailor while he is on his voyage what would you be doing when death surprises you for you must be surprised when you are doing something if you can be doing anything better than this when you are surprised do it for i wish to be surprised by disease 
or death when i am looking after nothing else than my own will that i may be free from perturbation that i may be free from hindrance free from compulsion and in a state of liberty i wish to be found practicing these things that i may be able to say to god have i in any respect transgressed thy commands have i in any respect wrongly used the powers which thou gavest me have i misused my perceptions or my preconceptions προλήψεσι have i ever blamed thee have i ever found fault with thy administration i have been sick because it was thy will and so have others but i was content to be sick i have been poor because it was thy will but i was content also i have not filled a magisterial office because it was not thy pleasure that i should i have never desired it hast thou ever seen me for this reason discontented have i not always approached thee with a cheerful countenance ready to do thy commands and to obey thy signals is it now thy will that i should depart from the assemblage of men i depart i give thee all th
anks that thou hast allowed me to join in this thy assemblage of men and to see thy works and to comprehend this thy administration may death surprise me while i am thinking of these things while i am thus writing and reading  but my mother will not hold my head when i am sick go to your mother then for you are a fit person to have your head held when you are sick but at home i used to lie down on a delicious bed go away to your bed indeed you are fit to lie on such a bed even when you are in health do not then lose what you can do there at home  but what does socrates say as one man he says is pleased with improving his land another with improving his horse so i am daily pleased in observing that i am growing better better in what in using nice little words man do not say that in little matters of speculation θεωρήματα what are you saying and indeed i do not see what else there is on which philosophers employ their time does it seem nothing to you to have never found fault with any person neither with god no
r man to have blamed nobody to carry the same face always in going out and coming in this is what socrates knew and yet he never said that he knew anything or taught anything but if any man asked for nice little words or little speculations he would carry him to protagoras or to hippias and if any man came to ask for potherbs he would carry him to the gardener who then among you has this purpose motive to action for if indeed you had it you would both be content in sickness and in hunger and in death if any among you has been in love with a charming girl he knows that i say what is true  vi miscellaneous when some person asked him how it happened that since reason has been more cultivated by the men of the present age the progress made in former times was greater in what respect he answered has it been more cultivated now and in what respect was the progress greater then for in that in which it has now been more cultivated in that also the progress will now be found at present it has been cultivated for the p
urpose of resolving syllogisms and progress is made but in former times it was cultivated for the purpose of maintaining the governing faculty in a condition conformable to nature and progress was made do not then mix things which are different and do not expect when you are laboring at one thing to make progress in another but see if any man among us when he is intent upon this the keeping himself in a state conformable to nature and living so always does not make progress for you will not find such a man  the good man is invincible for he does not enter the contest where he is not stronger if you his adversary want to have his land and all that is on it take the land take his slaves take his magisterial office take his poor body but you will not make his desire fail in that which it seeks nor his aversion fall into that which he would avoid the only contest into which he enters is that about things which are within the power of his will how then will he not be invincible  some person having asked him what i
s common sense epictetus replied as that may be called a certain common hearing which only distinguishes vocal sounds and that which distinguishes musical sounds is not common but artificial so there are certain things which men who are not altogether perverted see by the common notions which all possess such a constitution of the mind is named common sense  it is not easy to exhort weak young men for neither is it easy to hold soft cheese with a hook but those who have a good natural disposition even if you try to turn them aside cling still more to reason wherefore rufus generally attempted to discourage his pupils and he used this method as a test of those who had a good natural disposition and those who had not for it was his habit to say as a stone if you cast it upwards will be brought down to the earth by its own nature so the man whose mind is naturally good the more you repel him the more he turns towards that to which he is naturally inclined  vii to the administrator of the free cities who was an e
picurean when the administrator came to visit him and the man was an epicurean epictetus said it is proper for us who are not philosophers to inquire of you who are philosophers as those who come to a strange city inquire of the citizens and those who are acquainted with it what is the best thing in the world in order that we also after inquiry may go in quest of that which is best and look at it as strangers do with the things in cities for that there are three things which relate to mansoul body and things externalscarcely any man denies it remains for you philosophers to answer what is the best what shall we say to men is the flesh the best and was it for this that maximus sailed as far as cassiope in winter or bad weather with his son and accompanied him that he might be gratified in the flesh when the man said that it was not and added far be that from him is it not fit then epictetus said to be actively employed about the best it is certainly of all things the most fit what then do we possess which is b
etter than the flesh the soul he replied and the good things of the best are they better or the good things of the worse the good things of the best and are the good things of the best within the power of the will or not within the power of the will they are within the power of the will is then the pleasure of the soul a thing within the power of the will it is he replied and on what shall this pleasure depend on itself but that cannot be conceived for there must first exist a certain substance or nature οὐσία of good by obtaining which we shall have pleasure in the soul he assented to this also on what then shall we depend for this pleasure of the soul for if it shall depend on things of the soul the substance nature of the good is discovered for good cannot be one thing and that at which we are rationally delighted another thing nor if that which precedes is not good can that which comes after be good for in order that the thing which comes after may be good that which precedes must be good but you would no
t affirm this if you are in your right mind for you would then say what is inconsistent both with epicurus and the rest of your doctrines it remains then that the pleasure of the soul is in the pleasure from things of the body and again that those bodily things must be the things which precede and the substance nature of the good  for this reason maximus acted foolishly if he made the voyage for any other reason than for the sake of the flesh that is for the sake of the best and also a man acts foolishly if he abstains from that which belongs to others when he is a judge δικαστής and able to take it but if you please let us consider this only how this thing may be done secretly and safely and so that no man will know it for not even does epicurus himself declare stealing to be bad but he admits that detection is and because it is impossible to have security against detection for this reason he says do not steal but i say to you that if stealing is done cleverly and cautiously we shall not be detected further 
also we have powerful friends in rome both men and women and the hellenes greeks are weak and no man will venture to go up to rome for the purpose of complaining why do you refrain from your own good this is senseless foolish but even if you tell me that you do refrain i will not believe you for as it is impossible to assent to that which appears false and to turn away from that which is true so it is impossible to abstain from that which appears good but wealth is a good thing and certainly most efficient in producing pleasure why will you not acquire wealth and why should we not corrupt our neighbors wife if we can do it without detection and if the husband foolishly prates about the matter why not pitch him out of the house if you would be a philosopher such as you ought to be if a perfect philosopher if consistent with your own doctrines you must act thus if you would not you will not differ at all from us who are called stoics for we also say one thing but we do another we talk of the things which are be
autiful good but we do what is base but you will be perverse in the contrary way teaching what is bad practicing what is good  in the name of god are you thinking of a city of epicureans one man says i do not marrynor i for a man ought not to marry nor ought we to beget children nor engage in public matters what then will happen whence will the citizens come who will bring them up who will be governor of the youth who preside over gymnastic exercises and in what also will the teacher instruct them will he teach them what the lacedaemonians were taught or what the athenians were taught come take a young man bring him up according to your doctrines the doctrines are bad subversive of a state pernicious to families and not becoming to women dismiss them man you live in a chief city it is your duty to be a magistrate to judge justly to abstain from that which belongs to others no woman ought to seem beautiful to you except your own wife and no youth no vessel of silver no vessel of gold except your own seek for d
octrines which are consistent with what i say and by making them your guide you will with pleasure abstain from things which have such persuasive power to lead us and overpower us but if to the persuasive power of these things we also devise such a philosophy as this which helps to push us on towards them and strengthens us to this end what will be the conesquence in a piece of toreutic art which is the best part the silver or the workmanship the substance of the hand is the flesh but the work of the hand is the principal part that which precedes and leads the rest the duties then are also three those which are directed towards the existence of a thing those which are directed towards its existence in a particular kind and third the chief or leading things themselves so also in man we ought not to value the material the poor flesh but the principal leading things τὰ προηγούμενα what are these engaging in public business marrying begetting children venerating god taking care of parents and generally having des
ires aversions ἐκκλίνειν pursuits of things and avoidances in the way in which we ought to do these things and according to our nature and how are we constituted by nature free noble modest for what other animal blushes what other is capable of receiving the appearance the impression of shame and we are so constituted by nature as to subject pleasure to these things as a minister a servant in order that it may call forth our activity in order that it may keep us constant in acts which are conformable to nature  but i am rich and i want nothing why then do you pretend to be a philosopher your golden and your silver vessels are enough for you what need have you of principles opinions but i am also a judge κριτής of the greeks do you know how to judge who taught you to know caesar wrote to me a codicil let him write and give you a commission to judge of music and what will be the use of it to you still how did you become a judge whose hand did you kiss the hand of symphorus or numenius before whose bedchamber ha
ve you slept to whom have you sent gifts then do you not see that to be a judge is just of the same value as numenius is but i can throw into prison any man whom i please so you can do with a stone but i can beat with sticks whom i please so you may an ass this is not a governing of men govern us as rational animals show us what is profitable to us and we will follow it show us what is unprofitable and we will turn away from it make us imitators of yourself as socrates made men imitators of himself for he was like a governor of men who made them subject to him their desires their aversion their movements towards an object and their turning away from itdo this do not do this if you do not obey i will throw you into prisonthis is not governing men like rational animals but i say as zeus has ordained so act if you do not act so you will feel the penalty you will be punishedwhat will be the punishment nothing else than not having done your duty you will lose the character of fidelity modesty propriety do not look
 for greater penalties than these  viii how we must exercise ourselves against appearances φαντασίας as we exercise ourselves against sophistical questions so we ought to exercise ourselves daily against appearances for these appearances also propose questions to us a certain persons son is dead answer the thing is not within the power of the will it is not an evil a father has disinherited a certain son what do you think of it it is a thing beyond the power of the will not an evil caesar has condemned a person it is a thing beyond the power of the will not an evil the man is afflicted at this affliction is a thing which depends on the will it is an evil he has borne the condemnation bravely that is a thing within the power of the will it is a good if we train ourselves in this manner we shall make progress for we shall never assent to anything of which there is not an appearance capable of being comprehended your son is dead what has happened your son is dead nothing more nothing your ship is lost what has h
appened your ship is lost a man has been led to prison what has happened he has been led to prison but that herein he has fared badly every man adds from his own opinion but zeus you say does not do right in these matters why because he has made you capable of endurance because he has made you magnanimous because he has taken from that which befalls you the power of being evils because it is in your power to be happy while you are suffering what you suffer because he has opened the door to you when things do not please you man go out and do not complain  hear how the romans feel towards philosophers if you would like to know italicus who was the most in repute of the philosophers once when i was present being vexed with his own friends and as if he was suffering something intolerable said i cannot bear it you are killing me you will make me such as that man is pointing to me  ix to a certain rhetorician who was going up to rome on a suit when a certain person came to him who was going up to rome on account of
 a suit which had regard to his rank epictetus enquired the reason of his going to rome and the man then asked what he thought about the matter epictetus replied if you ask me what you will do in rome whether you will succeed or fail i have no rule θεώρημα about this but if you ask me how you will fare i can tell you if you have right opinions δόγματα you will fare well if they are false you will fare ill for to every man the cause of his acting is opinion for what is the reason why you desired to be elected governor of the cnossians your opinion what is the reason that you are now going up to rome your opinion and going in winter and with danger and expense i must go what tells you this your opinion then if opinions are the causes of all actions and a man has bad opinions such as the cause may be such also is the effect have we then all sound opinions both you and your adversary and how do you differ but have you sounder opinions than your adversary why you think so and so does he think that his opinions are
 better and so do madmen this is a bad criterion but show to me that you have made some inquiry into your opinions and have taken some pains about them and as now you are sailing to rome in order to become governor of the cnossians and you are not content to stay at home with the honors which you had but you desire something greater and more conspicuous so when did you ever make a voyage for the purpose of examining your own opinions and casting them out if you have any that are bad whom have you approached for this purpose what time have you fixed for it what age go over the times of your life by yourself if you are ashamed of me knowing the factwhen you were a boy did you examine your own opinions and did you not then as you do all things now do as you did do and when you were become a youth and attended the rhetoricians and yourself practiced rhetoric what did you imagine that you were deficient in and when you were a young man and engaged in public matters and pleaded causes yourself and were gaining repu
tation who then seemed your equal and when would you have submitted to any man examining and showing that your opinions are bad what then do you wish me to say to you help me in this matter i have no theorem rule for this nor have you if you came to me for this purpose come to me as a philosopher but as to a seller of vegetables or a shoemaker for what purpose then have philosophers theorems for this purpose that whatever may happen our ruling faculty may be and continue to be conformable to nature does this seem to you a small thing no but the greatest what then does it need only a short time and is it possible to seize it as you pass by if you can seize it  then you will say i met with epictetus as i should meet with a stone or a statue for you saw me and nothing more but he meets with a man as a man who learns his opinions and in his turn shows his own learn my opinions show me yours and then say that you have visited me let us examine one another if i have any bad opinion take it away if you have any show
 it this is the meaning of meeting with a philosopher not so you say but this is only a passing visit and while we are hiring the vessel we can also see epictetus let us see what he says then you go away and say epictetus was nothing he used solecisms and spoke in a barbarous way for of what else do you come as judgeswell but a man may say to me if i attend to such matters as you do i shall have no land as you have none i shall have no silver cups as you have none nor fine beasts as you have none in answer to this it is perhaps sufficient to say i have no need of such things but if you possess many things you have need of others whether you choose or not you are poorer than i am what then have i need of of that which you have not of firmness of a mind which is conformable to nature of being free from perturbation whether i have a patron or not what is that to me but it is something to you i am richer than you i am not anxious what caesar will think of me for this reason i flatter no man this is what i possess
 instead of vessels of silver and gold you have utensils of gold but your discourse your opinions your assents your movements pursuits your desires are of earthen ware but when i have these things conformable to nature why should i not employ my studies also upon reason for i have leisure my mind is not distracted what shall i do since i have no distraction what more suitable to a man have i than this when you have nothing to do you are disturbed you go to the theatre or you wander about without a purpose why should not the philosopher labor to improve his reason you employ yourself about crystal vessels i employ myself about the syllogism named the lying you about myrrhine vessels i employ myself about the syllogism named the denying τοῦ ἀποφάσκοντος to you everything appears small that you possess to me all that i have appears great your desire is insatiable mine is satisfied to children who put their hand into a narrownecked earthen vessel and bring out figs and nuts this happens if they fill the hand they
 cannot take it out and then they cry drop a few of them and you will draw things out and do you part with your desires do not desire many things and you will have what you want  x in what manner we ought to bear sickness when the need of each opinion comes we ought to have it in readiness on the occasion of breakfast such opinions as relate to breakfast in the bath those that concern the bath in bed those that concern bed  let sleep not come upon thy languid eyes before each daily action thou hast scannd whats done amiss what done what left undone from first to last examine all and then blame what is wrong in what is right rejoice and we ought to retain these verses in such way that we may use them not that we may utter them aloud as when we exclaim paean apollo again in fever we should have ready such opinions as concern a fever and we ought not as soon as the fever begins to lose and forget all a man who has a fever may say if i philosophize any longer may i be hanged wherever i go i must take care of the 
poor body that a fever may not come but what is philosophizing is it not a preparation against events which may happen do you not understand that you are saying something of this kind if i shall still prepare myself to bear with patience what happens may i be hanged but this is just as if a man after receiving blows should give up the pancratium in the pancratium it is in our power to desist and not to receive blows but in the other matter if we give up philosophy what shall we gain what then should a man say on the occasion of each painful thing it was for this that i exercised myself for this i disciplined myself god says to you give me a proof that you have duly practiced athletics that you have eaten what you ought that you have been exercised that you have obeyed the aliptes the oiler and rubber then do you show yourself weak when the time for action comes now is the time for the fever let it be borne well now is the time for thirst bear it well now is the time for hunger bear it well is it not in your p
ower who shall hinder you the physician will hinder you from drinking but he cannot prevent you from bearing thirst well and he will hinder you from eating but he cannot prevent you from bearing hunger well  but i cannot attend to my philosophical studies and for what purpose do you follow them slave is it not that you may be happy that you may be constant is it not that you may be in a state conformable to nature and live so what hinders you when you have a fever from having your ruling faculty conformable to nature here is the proof of the thing here is the test of the philosopher for this also is a part of life like walking like sailing like journeying by land so also is fever do you read when you are walking no nor do you when you have a fever but if you walk about well you have all that belongs to a man who walks if you bear a fever well you have all that belongs to a man in a fever what is it to bear a fever well not to blame god or man not to be afflicted at that which happens to expect death well and 
nobly to do what must be done when the physician comes in not to be frightened at what he says nor if he says you are doing well to be overjoyed for what good has he told you and when you were in health what good was that to you and even if he says you are in a bad way do not despond for what is it to be ill is it that you are near the severance of the soul and the body what harm is there in this if you are not near now will you not afterwards be near is the world going to be turned upside down when you are dead why then do you flatter the physician why do you say if you please master i shall be well why do you give him an opportunity of raising his eyebrows being proud or showing his importance do you not value a physician as you do a shoemaker when he is measuring your foot or a carpenter when he is building your house and so treat the physician as to the body which is not yours but by nature dead he who has a fever has an opportunity of doing this if he does these things he has what belongs to him for it i
s not the business of a philosopher to look after these externals neither his wine nor his oil nor his poor body but his own ruling power but as to externals how must he act so far as not to be careless about them where then is there reason for fear where is there then still reason for anger and of fear about what belongs to others about things which are of no value for we ought to have these two principles in readiness that except the will nothing is good nor bad and that we ought not to lead events but to follow them my brother ought not to have behaved thus to me no but he will see to that and however he may behave i will conduct myself towards him as i ought for this is my own business that belongs to another no man can prevent this the other thing can be hindered  xi certain miscellaneous matters there are certain penalties fixed as by law for those who disobey the divine administration whoever thinks any other thing to be good except those things which depend on the will let him envy let him desire let 
him flatter let him be perturbed whoever considers anything else to be evil let him grieve let him lament let him weep let him be unhappy and yet though so severely punished we cannot desist  remember what the poet says about the stranger  stranger i must not een if a worse man come this then may be applied even to a father i must not even if a worse man than you should come treat a father unworthily for all are from paternal zeus and let the same be said of a brother for all are from the zeus who presides over kindred and so in the other relations of life we shall find zeus to be an inspector  xii about exercise we ought not to make our exercises consist in means contrary to nature and adapted to cause admiration for if we do so we who call ourselves philosophers shall not differ at all from jugglers for it is difficult even to walk on a rope and not only difficult but it is also dangerous ought we for this reason to practice walking on a rope or setting up a palm tree or embracing statues by no means everyt
hing which is difficult and dangerous is not suitable for practice but that is suitable which conduces to the working out of that which is proposed to us and what is that which is proposed to us as a thing to be worked out to live with desire and aversion avoidance of certain things free from restraint and what is this neither to be disappointed in that which you desire nor to fall into anything which you would avoid towards this object then exercise practice ought to tend for since it is not possible to have your desire not disappointed and your aversion free from falling into that which you would avoid without great and constant practice you must know that if you allow your desire and aversion to turn to things which are not within the power of the will you will neither have your desire capable of attaining your object nor your aversion free from the power of avoiding that which you would avoid and since strong habit leads prevails and we are accustomed to employ desire and aversion only to things which are
 not within the power of our will we ought to oppose to this habit a contrary habit and where there is great slipperiness in the appearances there to oppose the habit of exercise  i am rather inclined to pleasure i will incline to the contrary side above measure for the sake of exercise i am averse to pain i will rub and exercise against this the appearances which are presented to me for the purpose of withdrawing my aversion from every such thing for who is a practitioner in exercise he who practices not using his desire and applies his aversion only to things which are within the power of his will and practices most in the things which are difficult to conquer for this reason one man must practice himself more against one thing and another against another thing what then is it to the purpose to set up a palm tree or to carry about a tent of skins or a mortar and pestle practice man if you are irritable to endure if you are abused not to be vexed if you are treated with dishonor then you will make so much pr
ogress that even if a man strikes you you will say to yourself imagine that you have embraced a statue then also exercise yourself to use wine properly so as not to drink much for in this also there are men who foolishly practice themselves but first of all you should abstain from it and abstain from a young girl and dainty cakes then at last if occasion presents itself for the purpose of trying yourself at a proper time you will descend into the arena to know if appearances overpower you as they did formerly but at first fly far from that which is stronger than yourself the contest is unequal between a charming young girl and a beginner in philosophy the earthen pitcher as the saying is and the rock do not agree  after the desire and the aversion comes the second topic matter of the movements towards action and the withdrawals from it that you may be obedient to reason that you do nothing out of season or place or contrary to any propriety of the kind the third topic concerns the assents which is related to 
the things which are persuasive and attractive for as socrates said we ought not to live a life without examination so we ought not to accept an appearance without examination but we should say wait let me see what you are and whence you come like the watch at night who says show me the pass the roman tessera have you the signal from nature which the appearance that may be accepted ought to have and finally whatever means are applied to the body by those who exercise it if they tend in any way towards desire and aversion they also may be fit means of exercise but if they are for display they are the indications of one who has turned himself towards something external and who is hunting for something else and who looks for spectators who will say oh the great man for this reason apollonius said well when you intend to exercise yourself for your own advantage and you are thirsty from heat take in a mouthful of cold water and spit it out and tell nobody  xiii what solitude is and what kind of person a solitary m
an is solitude is a certain condition of a helpless man for because a man is alone he is not for that reason also solitary just as though a man is among numbers he is not therefore not solitary when then we have lost either a brother or a son or a friend on whom we were accustomed to repose we say that we are left solitary though we are often in rome though such a crowd meet us though so many live in the same place and sometimes we have a great number of slaves for the man who is solitary as it is conceived is considered to be a helpless person and exposed to those who wish to harm him for this reason when we travel then especially do we say that we are lonely when we fall among robbers for it is not the sight of a human creature which removes us from solitude but the sight of one who is faithful and modest and helpful to us for if being alone is enough to make solitude you may say that even zeus is solitary in the conflagration and bewails himself saying unhappy that i am who have neither hera nor athena nor
 apollo nor brother nor son nor descendant nor kinsman this is what some say that he does when he is alone at the conflagration for they do not understand how a man passes his life when he is alone because they set out from a certain natural principle from the natural desire of community and mutual love and from the pleasure of conversation among men but nonetheless a man ought to be prepared in a manner for this also being alone to be able to be sufficient for himself and to be his own companion for as zeus dwells with himself and is tranquil by himself and thinks of his own administration and of its nature and is employed in thoughts suitable to himself so ought we also to be able to talk with ourselves not to feel the want of others also not to be unprovided with the means of passing our time to observe the divine administration and the relation of ourselves to everything else to consider how we formerly were affected towards things that happen and how at present what are still the things which give us pai
n how these also can be cured and how removed if any things require improvement to improve them according to reason  for you see that caesar appears to furnish us with great peace that there are no longer enemies nor battles nor great associations of robbers nor of pirates but we can travel at every hour and sail from east to west but can caesar give us security from fever also can he from shipwreck from fire from earthquake or from lightning well i will say can he give us security against love he cannot from sorrow he cannot from envy he cannot in a word then he cannot protect us from any of these things but the doctrine of philosophers promises to give us security peace even against these things and what does it say men if you will attend to me wherever you are whatever you are doing you will not feel sorrow nor anger nor compulsion nor hindrance but you will pass your time without perturbations and free from everything when a man has this peace not proclaimed by caesar for how should he be able to proclaim
 it but by god through reason is he not content when he is alone when he sees and reflects now no evil can happen to me for me there is no robber no earthquake everything is full of peace full of tranquillity every way every city every meeting neighbour companion is harmless one person whose business it is supplies me with food another with raiment another with perceptions and preconceptions προλήψεις and if he does not supply what is necessary he god gives the signal for retreat opens the door and says to you go go whither to nothing terrible but to the place from which you came to your friends and kinsmen to the elements what there was in you of fire goes to fire of earth to earth of air spirit to air of water to water no hades nor acheron nor cocytus nor pyriphlegethon but all is full of gods and daemons when a man has such things to think on and sees the sun the moon and stars and enjoys earth and sea he is not solitary nor even helpless well then if some man should come upon me when i am alone and murder
 me fool not murder you but your poor body  what kind of solitude then remains what want why do we make ourselves worse than children and what do children do when they are left alone they take up shells and ashes and they build something then pull it down and build something else and so they never want the means of passing the time shall i then if you sail away sit down and weep because i have been left alone and solitary shall i then have no shells no ashes but children do what they do through want of thought or deficiency in knowledge and we through knowledge are unhappy  every great power faculty is dangerous to beginners you must then bear such things as you are able but conformably to nature but not  practice sometimes a way of living like a person out of health that you may at some time live like a man in health abstain from food drink water abstain sometimes altogether from desire in order that you may some time desire consistently with reason and if consistently with reason when you have anything good
 in you you will desire wellnot so but we wish to live like wise men immediately and to be useful to menuseful how what are you doing have you been useful to yourself but i suppose you wish to exhort them you exhort them you wish to be useful to them show to them in your own example what kind of men philosophy makes and dont trifle when you are eating do good to those who eat with you when you are drinking to those who are drinking with you by yielding to all giving way bearing with them thus do them good and do not spit on them your phlegm bad humors  xiv certain miscellaneous matters as bad tragic actors cannot sing alone but in company with many so some persons cannot walk about alone man if you are anything both walk alone and talk to yourself and do not hide yourself in the chorus examine a little at last look around stir yourself up that you may know who you are  when a man drinks water or does anything for the sake of practice discipline whenever there is an opportunity he tells it to all i drink water
 is it for this that you drink water for the purpose of drinking water man if it is good for you to drink drink but if not you are acting ridiculously but if it is good for you and you do drink say nothing about it to those who are displeased with waterdrinkers what then do you wish to please these very men  of things that are done some are done with a final purpose προηγουμένως some according to occasion others with a certain reference to circumstances others for the purpose of complying with others and some according to a fixed scheme of life  you must root out of men these two things arrogance pride and distrust arrogance then is the opinion that you want nothing are deficient in nothing but distrust is the opinion that you cannot be happy when so many circumstances surround you arrogance is removed by confutation and socrates was the first who practiced this and to know that the thing is not impossible inquire and seek this search will do you no harm and in a manner this is philosophizing to seek how it i

 things so you also do you are at one time a wrestler athlete then a gladiator then a philosopher then a rhetorician but with your whole soul you are nothing like the ape you imitate all that you see and always one thing after another pleases you but that which becomes familiar displeases you for you have never undertaken anything after consideration nor after having explored the whole matter and put it to a strict examination but you have undertaken it at hazard and with a cold desire thus some persons having seen a philosopher and having heard one speak like euphratesand yet who can speak like himwish to be philosophers themselves  man consider first what the matter is which you propose to do then your own nature also what it is able to bear if you are a wrestler look at your shoulders your thighs your loins for different men are naturally formed for different things do you think that if you do what you are doing daily you can be a philosopher do you think that you can eat as you do now drink as you do now

e world now governed by providence but rufus replied did i ever incidentally form an argument from galba that the world is governed by providence  xvi that we ought with caution to enter into familiar intercourse with men if a man has frequent intercourse with others either for talk or drinking together or generally for social purposes he must either become like them or change them to his own fashion for if a man places a piece of quenched charcoal close to a piece that is burning either the quenched charcoal will quench the other or the burning charcoal will light that which is quenched since then the danger is so great we must cautiously enter into such intimacies with those of the common sort and remember that it is impossible that a man can keep company with one who is covered with soot without being partaker of the soot himself for what will you do if a man speaks about gladiators about horses about athletes or what is worse about men such a person is bad such a person is good this was well done this was
 done badly further if he scoff or ridicule or show an illnatured disposition is any man among us prepared like a luteplayer when he takes a lute so that as soon as he has touched the strings he discovers which are discordant and tunes the instrument such a power as socrates had who in all his social intercourse could lead his companions to his own purpose how should you have this power it is therefore a necessary consequence that you are carried about by the common kind of people  why then are they more powerful than you because they utter these useless words from their real opinions but you utter your elegant words only from your lips for this reason they are without strength and dead and it is nauseous to listen to your exhortations and your miserable virtue which is talked of everywhere up and down in this way the vulgar have the advantage over you for every opinion δόγμα is strong and invincible until then the good κομψαί sentiments ὑπολήψεις are fixed in you and you shall have acquired a certain power f
or your security i advise you to be careful in your association with common persons if you are not every day like wax in the sun there will be melted away whatever you inscribe on your minds in the school withdraw then yourselves far from the sun so long as you have these waxen sentiments for this reason also philosophers advise men to leave their native country because ancient habits distract them and do not allow a beginning to be made of a different habit nor can we tolerate those who meet us and say see such a one is now a philosopher who was once soandso thus also physicians send those who have lingering diseases to a different country and a different air and they do right do you also introduce other habits than those which you have fix your opinions and exercise yourselves in them but you do not so you go hence to a spectacle to a show of gladiators to a place of exercise ξυστόν to a circus then you come back hither and again from this place you go to those places and still the same persons and there is
 no pleasing good habit nor attention nor care about self and observation of this kind how shall i use the appearances presented to me according to nature or contrary to nature how do i answer to them as i ought or as i ought not do i say to those things which are independent of the will that they do not concern me for if you are not yet in this state fly from your former habits fly from the common sort if you intend ever to begin to be something  xvii on providence when you make any charge against providence consider and you will learn that the thing has happened according to reason yes but the unjust man has the advantage in what in money yes for he is superior to you in this that he flatters is free from shame and is watchful what is the wonder but see if he has the advantage over you in being faithful in being modest for you will not find it to be so but wherein you are superior there you will find that you have the advantage and i once said to a man who was vexed because philostorgus was fortunate would 
you choose to lie with suramay it never happen he replied that this day should come why then are you vexed if he receives something in return for that which he sells or how can you consider him happy who acquires those things by such means as you abominate or what wrong does providence if he gives the better things to the better men is it not better to be modest than to be richhe admitted thiswhy are you vexed then man when you possess the better thing remember then always and have in readiness the truth that this is a law of naturethat the superior has an advantage over the inferior in that in which he is superiorand you will never be vexed  but my wife treats me badly well if any man asks you what this is say my wife treats me badly is there then nothing more nothingmy father gives me nothingwhat is this my father gives me nothingis there nothing else thennothing but to say that this is an evil is something which must be added to it externally and falsely added for this reason we must not get rid of poverty
 but of the opinion about poverty and then we shall be happy  xviii that we ought not to be disturbed by any news when anything shall be reported to you which is of a nature to disturb have this principle in readiness that the news is about nothing which is within the power of your will can any man report to you that you have formed a bad opinion or had a bad desire by no means but perhaps he will report that some person is dead what then is that to you he may report that some person speaks ill of you what then is that to you or that your father is planning something or other against whom against your will προαίρεσις how can he but is it against your poor body against your little property you are quite safe it is not against you but the judge declares that you have committed an act of impiety and did not the judges δίκασται make the same declaration against socrates does it concern you that the judge has made this declaration no why then do you trouble yourself any longer about it your father has a certain du
ty and if he shall not fulfil it he loses the character of a father of a man of natural affection of gentleness do not wish him to lose anything else on this account for never does a man do wrong in one thing and suffer in another on the other side it is your duty to make your defense firmly modestly without anger but if you do not you also lose the character of a son of a man of modest behavior of generous character well then is the judge free from danger no but he also is in equal danger why then are you still afraid of his decision what have you to do with that which is another mans evil it is your own evil to make a bad defense be on your guard against this only but to be condemned or not to be condemned as that is the act of another person so it is the evil of another person a certain person threatens you me no he blames you let him see how he manages his own affairs he is going to condemn you unjustly he is a wretched man  xix what is the condition of a common kind of man and of a philosopher the first 
difference between a common person ἰδιώτης and a philosopher is this the common person says woe to me for my little child for my brother for my father the philosopher if he shall ever be compelled to say woe to me stops and says but for myself for nothing which is independent of the will can hinder or damage the will and the will can only hinder or damage itself if then we ourselves incline in this direction so as when we are unlucky to blame ourselves and to remember that nothing else is the cause of perturbation or loss of tranquillity except our own opinion i swear to you by all the gods that we have made progress but in the present state of affairs we have gone another way from the beginning for example while we were still children the nurse if we ever stumbled through want of care did not chide us but would beat the stone but what did the stone do ought the stone to have moved on account of your childs folly again if we find nothing to eat on coming out of the bath the pedagogue never checks our appetite
 but he flogs the cook man did we make you the pedagogue of the cook and not of the child correct the child improve him in this way even when we are grown up we are like children for he who is unmusical is a child in music he who is without letters is a child in learning he who is untaught is a child in life  xx that we can derive advantage from all external things in the case of appearances which are objects of the vision nearly all have allowed the good and the evil to be in ourselves and not in externals no one gives the name of good to the fact that it is day nor bad to the fact that it is night nor the name of the greatest evil to the opinion that three are four but what do men say they say that knowledge is good and that error is bad so that even in respect to falsehood itself there is a good result the knowledge that it is falsehood so it ought to be in life also is health a good thing and is sickness a bad thing no man but what is it to be healthy and healthy in a right way is good to be healthy in a 
bad way is bad so that it is possible to gain advantage even from sickness i declare for is it not possible to gain advantage even from death and is it not possible to gain advantage from mutilation do you think that menoeceus gained little by death could a man who says so gain so much as menoeceus gained come man did he not maintain the character of being a lover of his country a man of great mind faithful generous and if he had continued to live would he not have lost all these things would he not have gained the opposite would he not have gained the name of coward ignoble a hater of his country a man who feared death well do you think that he gained little by dying i suppose not but did the father of admetus gain much by prolonging his life so ignobly and miserably did he not die afterwards cease i adjure you by the gods to admire material things cease to make yourselves slaves first of things then on account of things slaves of those who are able to give them or take them away  can advantage then be deriv
ed from these things from all and from him who abuses you wherein does the man who exercises before the combat profit the athlete very greatly this man becomes my exerciser before the combat he exercises me in endurance in keeping my temper in mildness you say no but he who lays hold of my neck and disciplines my loins and shoulders does me good and the exercise master the aliptes or oiler does right when he says raise him up with both hands and the heavier he ἐκεῖνος is so much the more is my advantage but if a man exercises me in keeping my temper does he not do me goodthis is not knowing how to gain an advantage from men is my neighbour bad bad to himself but good to me he exercises my good disposition my moderation is my father bad bad to himself but to me good this is the rod of hermes touch with it what you please as the saying is and it will be of gold i say not so but bring what you please and i will make it good bring disease bring death bring poverty bring abuse bring trial on capital charges all th
ese things through the rod of hermes shall be made profitable what will you do with death why what else than that it shall do you honor or that it shall show you by act through it what a man is who follows the will of nature what will you do with disease i will show its nature i will be conspicuous in it i will be firm i will be happy i will not flatter the physician i will not wish to die what else do you seek whatever you shall give me i will make it happy fortunate honored a thing which a man shall seek  you say no but take care that you do not fall sick it is a bad thing this is the same as if you should say take care that you never receive the impression appearance that three are four that is bad man how is it bad if i think about it as i ought how shall it then do me any damage and shall it not even do me good if then i think about poverty as i ought to do about disease about not having office is not that enough for me will it not be an advantage how then ought i any longer to look to seek evil and good
 in externals what happens these doctrines are maintained here but no man carries them away home but immediately everyone is at war with his slave with his neighbours with those who have sneered at him with those who have ridiculed him good luck to lesbius who daily proves that i know nothing  xxi against those who readily come to the profession of sophists they who have taken up bare theorems θεωρήματα immediately wish to vomit them forth as persons whose stomach is diseased do with food first digest the thing then do not vomit it up thus if you do not digest it the thing becomes truly an emetic a crude food and unfit to eat but after digestion show us some change in your ruling faculty as athletes show in their shoulders by what they have been exercised and what they have eaten as those who have taken up certain arts show by what they have learned the carpenter does not come and say hear me talk about the carpenters art but having undertaken to build a house he makes it and proves that he knows the art you 
also ought to do something of the kind eat like a man drink like a man dress marry beget children do the office of a citizen endure abuse bear with an unreasonable brother bear with your father bear with your son neighbour companion show us these things that we may see that you have in truth learned something from the philosophers you say no but come and hear me read philosophical commentaries go away and seek somebody to vomit them on he replies and indeed i will expound to you the writings of chrysippus as no other man can i will explain his text most clearly i will add also if i can the vehemence of antipater and archedemus  is it then for this that young men shall leave their country and their parents that they may come to this place and hear you explain words ought they not to return with a capacity to endure to be active in association with others free from passions free from perturbation with such a provision for the journey of life with which they shall be able to bear well the things that happen and 
derive honor from them and how can you give them any of these things which you do not possess have you done from the beginning anything else than employ yourself about the resolution of syllogisms of sophistical arguments οἱ μεταπίπτοντες and in those which work by questions but such a man has a school why should not i also have a school these things are not done man in a careless way nor just as it may happen but there must be a fit age and life and god as a guide you say no but no man sails from a port without having sacrificed to the gods and invoked their help nor do men sow without having called on demeter and shall a man who has undertaken so great a work undertake it safely without the gods and shall they who undertake this work come to it with success what else are you doing man than divulging the mysteries you say there is a temple at eleusis and one here also there is an hierophant at eleusis and i also will make an hierophant there is a herald and i will establish a herald there is a torchbearer at
 eleusis and i also will establish a torchbearer there are torches at eleusis and i will have torches here the words are the same how do the things done here differ from those done there most impious man is there no difference these things are done both in due place and in due time and when accompanied with sacrifice and prayers when a man is first purified and when he is disposed in his mind to the thought that he is going to approach sacred rites and ancient rites in this way the mysteries are useful in this way we come to the notion that all these things were established by the ancients for the instruction and correction of life but you publish and divulge them out of time out of place without sacrifices without purity you have not the garments which the hierophant ought to have nor the hair nor the headdress nor the voice nor the age nor have you purified yourself as he has but you have committed to memory the words only and you say sacred are the words by themselves you ought to approach these matters in
 another way the thing is great it is mystical not a common thing nor is it given to every man but not even wisdom perhaps is enough to enable a man to take care of youths a man must have also a certain readiness and fitness for this purpose and a certain quality of body and above all things he must have god to advise him to occupy this office as god advised socrates to occupy the place of one who confutes error diogenes the office of royalty and reproof and the office of teaching precepts but you open a doctors shop though you have nothing except physic but where and how they should be applied you know not nor have you taken any trouble about it see that man says i too have salves for the eyes have you also the power of using them do you know both when and how they will do good and to whom they will do good why then do you act at hazard in things of the greatest importance why are you careless why do you undertake a thing that is in no way fit for you leave it to those who are able to do it and to do it well
 do not yourself bring disgrace on philosophy through your own acts and be not one of those who load it with a bad reputation but if theorems please you sit still and turn them over by yourself but never say that you are a philosopher nor allow another to say it but say he is mistaken for neither are my desires different from what they were before nor is my activity directed to other objects nor do i assent to other things nor in the use of appearances have i altered at all from my former condition this you must think and say about yourself if you would think as you ought if not act at hazard and do what you are doing for it becomes you  xxii about cynism when one of his pupils inquired of epictetus and he was a person who appeared to be inclined to cynism what kind of person a cynic ought to be and what was the notion πρόληψις of the thingwe will inquire said epictetus at leisure but i have so much to say to you that he who without god attempts so great a matter is hateful to god and has no other purpose tha
n to act indecently in public for in any wellmanaged house no man comes forward and says to himself i ought to be manager of the house if he does so the master turns round and seeing him insolently giving orders drags him forth and flogs him so it is also in this great city the world for here also there is a master of the house who orders everything he says you are the sun you can by going round make the year and seasons and make the fruits grow and nourish them and stir the winds and make them remit and warm the bodies of men properly go travel round and so administer things from the greatest to the least you are a calf when a lion shall appear do your proper business ie run away if you do not you will suffer you are a bull advance and fight for this is your business and becomes you and you can do it you can lead the army against ilium be agamemnon you can fight in single combat against hector be achilles but if thersites came forward and claimed the command he would either not have obtained it or if he did 
obtain it he would have disgraced himself before many witnesses  do you also think about the matter carefully it is not what it seems to you you say i wear a cloak now and i shall wear it then i sleep hard now and i shall sleep hard then i will take in addition a little bag now and a staff and i will go about and begin to beg and to abuse those whom i meet and if i see any man plucking the hair out of his body i will rebuke him or if he has dressed his hair or if he walks about in purple if you imagine the thing to be such as this keep far away from it do not approach it it is not at all for you but if you imagine it to be what it is and do not think yourself to be unfit for it consider what a great thing you undertake  in the first place in the things which relate to yourself you must not be in any respect like what you do now you must not blame god or man you must take away desire altogether you must transfer avoidance ἔκκλισις only to the things which are within the power of the will you must not feel ange
r nor resentment nor envy nor pity a girl must not appear handsome to you nor must you love a little reputation nor be pleased with a boy or a cake for you ought to know that the rest of men throw walls around them and houses and darkness when they do any such things and they have many means of concealment a man shuts the door he sets somebody before the chamber if a person comes say that he is out he is not at leisure but the cynic instead of all these things must use modesty as his protection if he does not he will be indecent in his nakedness and under the open sky this is his house his door this is the slave before his bedchamber this is his darkness for he ought not to wish to hide anything that he does and if he does he is gone he has lost the character of a cynic of a man who lives under the open sky of a free man he has begun to fear some external thing he has begun to have need of concealment nor can he get concealment when he chooses for where shall he hide himself and how and if by chance this publ
ic instructor shall be detected this pedagogue what kind of things will he be compelled to suffer when then a man fears these things is it possible for him to be bold with his whole soul to superintend men it cannot be it is impossible  in the first place then you must make your ruling faculty pure and this mode of life also now you should say to me the matter to work on is my understanding as wood is to the carpenter as hides to the shoemaker and my business is the right use of appearances but the body is nothing to me the parts of it are nothing to me death let it come when it chooses either death of the whole or of a part fly you say and whither can any man eject me out of the world he cannot but wherever i go there is the sun there is the moon there are the stars dreams omens and the conversation ὁμιλία with gods  then if he is thus prepared the true cynic cannot be satisfied with this but he must know that he is sent a messenger from zeus to men about good and bad things to show them that they have wande
red and are seeking the substance of good and evil where it is not but where it is they never think and that he is a spy as diogenes was carried off to philip after the battle of chaeroneia as a spy for in fact a cynic is a spy of the things which are good for men and which are evil and it is his duty to examine carefully and to come and report truly and not to be struck with terror so as to point out as enemies those who are not enemies nor in any other way to be perturbed by appearances nor confounded  it is his duty then to be able with a loud voice if the occasion should arise and appearing on the tragic stage to say like socrates men whither are you hurrying what are you doing wretches like blind people you are wandering up and down you are going by another road and have left the true road you seek for prosperity and happiness where they are not and if another shows you where they are you do not believe him why do you seek it without in the body it is not there if you doubt look at myro look at ophellius
 in possessions it is not there but if you do not believe me look at croesus look at those who are now rich with what lamentations their life is filled in power it is not there if it is those must be happy who have been twice and thrice consuls but they are not whom shall we believe in these matters you who from without see their affairs and are dazzled by an appearance or the men themselves what do they say hear them when they groan when they grieve when on account of these very consulships and glory and splendour they think that they are more wretched and in greater danger is it in royal power it is not if it were nero would have been happy and sardanapalus but neither was agamemnon happy though he was a better man than sardanapalus and nero but while others are snoring what is he doing  much from his head he tore his rooted hair iliad x  and what does he say himself  i am perplexed he says and disturbd i am and my heart out of my bosom is leaping iliad x  wretch which of your affairs goes badly your posses
sions no your body no but you are rich in gold and copper what then is the matter with you that part of you whatever it is has been neglected by you and is corrupted the part with which we desire with which we avoid with which we move towards and move from things how neglected he knows not the nature of good for which he is made by nature and the nature of evil and what is his own and what belongs to another and when anything that belongs to others goes badly he says woe to me for the hellenes are in danger wretched is his ruling faculty and alone neglected and uncared for the hellenes are going to die destroyed by the trojans and if the trojans do not kill them will they not die yes but not all at once what difference then does it make for if death is an evil whether men die altogether or if they die singly it is equally an evil is anything else then going to happen than the separation of the soul and the body nothing and if the hellenes perish is the door closed and is it not in your power to die it is why 
then do you lament and say oh you who are a king and have the sceptre of zeus an unhappy king does not exist more than an unhappy god what then art thou in truth a shepherd for you weep as shepherds do when a wolf has carried off one of their sheep and these who are governed by you are sheep and why did you come hither was your desire in any danger was your aversion ἔκκλισις was your movement pursuits was your avoidance of things he replies no but the wife of my brother was carried off was it not then a great gain to be deprived of an adulterous wife shall we be despised then by the trojans what kind of people are the trojans wise or foolish if they are wise why do you fight with them if they are fools why do you care about them  in what then is the good since it is not in these things tell us you who are lord messenger and spy where you do not think that it is nor choose to seek it for if you chose to seek it you would have found it to be in yourselves nor would you be wandering out of the way nor seeking wh
at belongs to others as if it were your own turn your thoughts into yourselves observe the preconceptions which you have what kind of a thing do you imagine the good to be that which flows easily that which is happy that which is not impeded come and do you not naturally imagine it to be great do you not imagine it to be valuable do you not imagine it to be free from harm in what material then ought you to seek for that which flows easily for that which is not impeded in that which serves or in that which is free in that which is free do you possess the body then free or is it in servile condition we do not know do you not know that it is the slave of fever of gout ophthalmia dysentery of a tyrant of fire of iron of everything which is stronger yes it is a slave how then is it possible that anything which belongs to the body can be free from hindrance and how is a thing great or valuable which is naturally dead or earth or mud well then do you possess nothing which is free perhaps nothing and who is able to c
ompel you to assent to that which appears false no man and who can compel you not to assent to that which appears true no man by this then you see that there is something in you naturally free but to desire or to be averse from or to move towards an object or to move from it or to prepare yourself or to propose to do anything which of you can do this unless he has received an impression of the appearance of that which is profitable or a duty no man you have then in these things also something which is not hindered and is free wretched men work out this take care of this seek for good here  and how is it possible that a man who has nothing who is naked houseless without a hearth squalid without a slave without a city can pass a life that flows easily see god has sent you a man to show you that it is possible look at me who am without a city without a house without possessions without a slave i sleep on the ground i have no wife no children no praetorium but only the earth and heavens and one poor cloak and wha
t do i want am i not without sorrow am i not without fear am i not free when did any of you see me failing in the object of my desire or ever falling into that which i would avoid did i ever blame god or man did i ever accuse any man did any of you ever see me with sorrowful countenance and how do i meet with those whom you are afraid of and admire do not i treat them like slaves who when he sees me does not think that he sees his king and master  this is the language of the cynics this their character this is their purpose you say no but their characteristic is the little wallet and staff and great jaws the devouring of all that you give them or storing it up or the abusing unseasonably all whom they meet or displaying their shoulder as a fine thing do you see how you are going to undertake so great a business first take a mirror look at your shoulders observe your loins your thighs you are going my man to be enrolled as a combatant in the olympic games no frigid and miserable contest in the olympic games a 
man is not permitted to be conquered only and to take his departure but first he must be disgraced in the sight of all the world not in the sight of athenians only or of lacedaemonians or of nicopolitans next he must be whipped also if he has entered into the contests rashly and before being whipped he must suffer thirst and heat and swallow much dust  reflect more carefully know thyself consult the divinity without god attempt nothing for if he shall advise you to do this or anything be assured that he intends you to become great or to receive many blows for this very amusing quality is conjoined to a cynic he must be flogged like an ass and when he is flogged he must love those who flog him as if he were the father of all and the brother of allyou say no but if a man flogs you stand in the public place and call out caesar what do i suffer in this state of peace under thy protection let us bring the offender before the proconsul but what is caesar to a cynic or what is a proconsul or what is any other except
 him who sent the cynic down hither and whom he serves namely zeus does he call upon any other than zeus is he not convinced that whatever he suffers it is zeus who is exercising him hercules when he was exercised by eurystheus did not think that he was wretched but without hesitation he attempted to execute all that he had in hand and is he who is trained to the contest and exercised by zeus going to call out and to be vexed he who is worthy to bear the sceptre of diogenes hear what diogenes says to the passers by when he is in a fever miserable wretches will you not stay but are you going so long a journey to olympia to see the destruction or the fight of athletes and will you not choose to see the combat between a fever and a man would such a man accuse god who sent him down as if god were treating him unworthily a man who gloried in his circumstances and claimed to be an example to those who were passing by for what shall he accuse him of because he maintains a decency of behavior because he displays his 
virtue more conspicuously well and what does he say of poverty about death about pain how did he compare his own happiness with that of the great king the king of persia or rather he thought that there was no comparison between them for where there are perturbations and griefs and fears and desires not satisfied and aversions of things which you cannot avoid and envies and jealousies how is there a road to happiness there but where there are corrupt principles there these things must of necessity be  when the young man asked if when a cynic has fallen sick and a friend asks him to come to his house and to be taken care of in his sickness shall the cynic accept the invitation he replied and where shall you find i ask a cynics friend for the man who invites ought to be such another as the cynic that he may be worthy of being reckoned the cynics friend he ought to be a partner in the cynics sceptre and his royalty and a worthy minister if he intends to be considered worthy of a cynics friendship as diogenes was 
a friend of antisthenes as crates was a friend of diogenes do you think that if a man comes to a cynic and salutes him that he is the cynics friend and that the cynic will think him worthy of receiving a cynic into his house so that if you please reflect on this also rather look round for some convenient dunghill on which you shall bear your fever and which will shelter you from the north wind that you may not be chilled but you seem to me to wish to go into some mans house and to be well fed there for a time why then do you think of attempting so great a thing as the life of a cynic  but said the young man shall marriage and the procreation of children as a chief duty be undertaken by the cynic if you grant me a community of wise men epictetus replies perhaps no man will readily apply himself to the cynic practice for on whose account should he undertake this manner of life however if we suppose that he does nothing will prevent him from marrying and begetting children for his wife will be another like himse
lf and his father in law another like himself and his children will be brought up like himself but in the present state of things which is like that of an army placed in battle order is it not fit that the cynic should without any distraction be employed only on the ministration of god able to go about among men not tied down to the common duties of mankind nor entangled in the ordinary relations of life which if he neglects he will not maintain the character of an honorable and good man and if he observes them he will lose the character of the messenger and spy and herald of god for consider that it is his duty to do something towards his father in law something to the other kinsfolks of his wife something to his wife also if he has one he is also excluded by being a cynic from looking after the sickness of his own family and from providing for their support and to say nothing of the rest he must have a vessel for heating water for the child that he may wash it in the bath wool for his wife when she is deliv
ered of a child oil a bed a cup so the furniture of the house is increased i say nothing of his other occupations and of his distraction where then now is that king he who devotes himself to the public interests  the peoples guardian and so full of cares homer iliad ii  whose duty it is to look after others the married and those who have children to see who uses his wife well who uses her badly who quarrels what family is well administered what is not going about as a physician does and feels pulses he says to one you have a fever to another you have a headache or the gout he says to one abstain from food to another he says eat or do not use the bath to another you require the knife or the cautery how can he have time for this who is tied to the duties of common life is it not his duty to supply clothing to his children and to send them to the schoolmaster with writing tablets and styles for writing besides must he not supply them with beds for they cannot be genuine cynics as soon as they are born if he does
 not do this it would be better to expose the children as soon as they are born than to kill them in this way consider what we are bringing the cynic down to how we are taking his royalty from him yes but crates took a wife you are speaking of a circumstance which arose from love and of a woman who was another crates but we are inquiring about ordinary marriages and those which are free from distractions and making this inquiry we do not find the affair of marriage in this state of the world a thing which is especially suited to the cynic  how then shall a man maintain the existence of society in the name of god are those men greater benefactors to society who introduce into the world to occupy their own places two or three grunting children or those who superintend as far as they can all mankind and see what they do how they live what they attend to what they neglect contrary to their duty did they who left little children to the thebans do them more good than epaminondas who died childless and did priamus w
ho begat fifty worthless sons or danaus or aeolus contribute more to the community than homer then shall the duty of a general or the business of a writer exclude a man from marriage or the begetting of children and such a man shall not be judged to have accepted the condition of childlessness for nothing and shall not the royalty of a cynic be considered an equivalent for the want of children do we not perceive his grandeur and do we not justly contemplate the character of diogenes and do we instead of this turn our eyes to the present cynics who are dogs that wait at tables and in no respect imitate the cynics of old except perchance in breaking wind but in nothing else for such matters would not have moved us at all nor should we have wondered if a cynic should not marry or beget children man the cynic is the father of all men the men are his sons the women are his daughters he so carefully visits all so well does he care for all do you think that it is from idle impertinence that he rebukes those whom he 
meets he does it as a father as a brother and as the minister of the father of all the minister of zeus  if you please ask me also if a cynic shall engage in the administration of the state fool do you seek a greater form of administration than that in which he is engaged do you ask if he shall appear among the athenians and say something about the revenues and the supplies he who must talk with all men alike with athenians alike with corinthians alike with romans not about supplies nor yet about revenues nor about peace or war but about happiness and unhappiness about good fortune and bad fortune about slavery and freedom when a man has undertaken the administration of such a state do you ask me if he shall engage in the administration of a state ask me also if he shall govern hold a magisterial office again i will say to you fool what greater government shall he exercise than that which he exercises now  it is necessary also for such a man the cynic to have a certain habit of body for if he appears to be co
nsumptive thin and pale his testimony has not then the same weight for he must not only by showing the qualities of the soul prove to the vulgar that it is in his power independent of the things which they admire to be a good man but he must also show by his body that his simple and frugal way of living in the open air does not injure even the body see he says i am a proof of this and my own body also is so diogenes used to do for he used to go about fresh looking and he attracted the notice of the many by his personal appearance but if a cynic is an object of compassion he seems to be a beggar all persons turn away from him all are offended with him for neither ought he to appear dirty so that he shall not also in this respect drive away men but his very roughness ought to be clean and attractive  there ought also to belong to the cynic much natural grace and sharpness and if this is not so he is a stupid fellow and nothing else and he must have these qualities that he may be able readily and fitly to be a m
atch for all circumstances that may happen so diogenes replied to one who said are you the diogenes who does not believe that there are gods and how replied diogenes can this be when i think that you are odious to the gods on another occasion in reply to alexander who stood by him when he was sleeping and quoted homers line iliad ii   a man a councillor should not sleep all night he answered when he was half asleep  the peoples guardian and so full of cares but before all the cynics ruling faculty must be purer than the sun and if it is not he must necessarily be a cunning knave and a fellow of no principle since while he himself is entangled in some vice he will reprove others for see how the matter stands to these kings and tyrants their guards and arms give the power of reproving some persons and of being able even to punish those who do wrong though they are themselves bad but to a cynic instead of arms and guards it is conscience τὸ συνειδός which gives this power when he knows that he has watched and la
bored for mankind and has slept pure and sleep has left him still purer and that he thought whatever he has thought as a friend of the gods as a minister as a participator of the power of zeus and that on all occasions he is ready to say  lead me o zeus and thou o destiny and also if so it pleases the gods so let it be why should he not have confidence to speak freely to his own brothers to his children in a word to his kinsmen for this reason he is neither over curious nor a busybody when he is in this state of mind for he is not a meddler with the affairs of others when he is superintending human affairs but he is looking after his own affairs if that is not so you may also say that the general is a busybody when he inspects his soldiers and examines them and watches them and punishes the disorderly but if while you have a cake under your arm you rebuke others i will say to you will you not rather go away into a corner and eat that which you have stolen what have you to do with the affairs of others for who
 are you are you the bull of the herd or the queen of the bees show me the tokens of your supremacy such as they have from nature but if you are a drone claiming the sovereignty over the bees do you not suppose that your fellow citizens will put you down as the bees do the drones  the cynic also ought to have such power of endurance as to seem insensible to the common sort and a stone no man reviles him no man strikes him no man insults him but he gives his body that any man who chooses may do with it what he likes for he bears in mind that the inferior must be overpowered by the superior in that in which it is inferior and the body is inferior to the many the weaker to the stronger he never then descends into such a contest in which he can be overpowered but he immediately withdraws from things which belong to others he claims not the things which are servile but where there is will and the use of appearances there you will see how many eyes he has so that you may say argus was blind compared with him is his
 assent ever hasty his movement towards an object rash does his desire ever fail in its object does that which he would avoid befall him is his purpose unaccomplished does he ever find fault is he ever humiliated is he ever envious to these he directs all his attention and energy but as to everything else he snores supine all is peace there is no robber who takes away his will no tyrant but what say you as to his body i say there is and his possessions i say there is and as to magistracies and honorswhat does he care for themwhen then any person would frighten him through them he says to him begone look for children masks are formidable to them but i know that they are made of shell and they have nothing inside  about such a matter as this you are deliberating therefore if you please i urge you in gods name defer the matter and first consider your preparation for it for see what hector says to andromache retire rather he says into the house and weave  war is the work of men of all indeed but specially tis min
e iliad vi  so he was conscious of his own qualification and knew her weakness  xxiii to those who read and discuss for the sake of ostentation first say to yourself who you wish to be then do accordingly what you are doing for in nearly all other things we see this to be so those who follow athletic exercises first determine what they wish to be then they do accordingly what follows if a man is a runner in the long course there is a certain kind of diet of walking rubbing and exercise if a man is a runner in the stadium all these things are different if he is a pentathlete they are still more different so you will find it also in the arts if you are a carpenter you will have such and such things if a worker in metal such things for everything that we do if we refer it to no end we shall do it to no purpose and if we refer it to the wrong end we shall miss the mark further there is a general end or purpose and a particular purpose first of all we must act as a man what is comprehended in this we must not be l
ike a sheep though gentle nor mischievous like a wild beast but the particular end has reference to each persons mode of life and his will the luteplayer acts as a luteplayer the carpenter as a carpenter the philosopher as a philosopher the rhetorician as a rhetorician when then you say come and hear me read to you take care first of all that you are not doing this without a purpose then if you have discovered that you are doing this with reference to a purpose consider if it is the right purpose do you wish to do good or to be praised immediately you hear him saying to me what is the value of praise from the many and he says well for it is of no value to a musician so far as he is a musician nor to a geometrician do you then wish to be useful in what tell us that we may run to your audience room now can a man do anything useful to others who has not received something useful himself no for neither can a man do anything useful in the carpenters art unless he is a carpenter nor in the shoemakers art unless he 
is a shoemaker  do you wish to know then if you have received any advantage produce your opinions philosopher what is the thing which desire promises not to fail in the object what does aversion promise not to fall into that which you would avoid well do we fulfill their promise tell me the truth but if you lie i will tell you lately when your hearers came together rather coldly and did not give you applause you went away humbled lately again when you had been praised you went about and said to all what did you think of me wonderful master i swear by all that is dear to me but how did i treat of that particular matter which the passage in which i described pan and the nymphs excellently then do you tell me that in desire and in aversion you are acting according to nature be gone try to persuade somebody else did you not praise a certain person contrary to your opinion and did you not flatter a certain person who was the son of a senator would you wish your own children to be such personsi hope notwhy then did
 you praise and flatter him he is an ingenuous youth and listens well to discourses how is this he admires me you have stated your proof then what do you think do not these very people secretly despise you when then a man who is conscious that he has neither done any good nor ever thinks of it finds a philosopher who says you have a great natural talent and you have a candid and good disposition what else do you think that he says except this this man has some need of me or tell me what act that indicates a great mind has he shown observe he has been in your company a long time he has listened to your discourses he has heard you reading has he become more modest has he been turned to reflect on himself has he perceived in what a bad state he is has he cast away selfconceit does he look for a person to teach him he does a man who will teach him to live no fool but how to talk for it is for this that he admires you also listen and hear what he says this man writes with perfect art much better than dion this is 
altogether another thing does he say this man is modest faithful free from perturbations and even if he did say it i should say to him since this man is faithful tell me what this faithful man is and if he could not tell me i should add this first understand what you say and then speak  you then who are in a wretched plight and gaping after applause and counting your auditors do you intend to be useful to others today many more attended my discourse yes many we suppose five hundred that is nothing suppose that there were a thousanddion never had so many hearershow could heand they understand what is said beautifully what is fine master can move even a stonesee these are the words of a philosopher this is the disposition of a man who will do good to others here is a man who has listened to discourses who has read what is written about socrates as socratic not as the compositions of lysias and isocrates  i have often wondered by what arguments  not so but by what argument this is more exact than thatwhat have y
ou read the words at all in a different way from that in which you read little odes for if you read them as you ought you would not have been attending to such matters but you would rather have been looking to these words anytus and melitus are able to kill me but they cannot harm me and i am always of such a disposition as to pay regard to nothing of my own except to the reason which on inquiry seems to me the best hence who ever heard socrates say i know something and i teach but he used to send different people to different teachers therefore they used to come to him and ask to be introduced to philosophers by him and he would take them and recommend themnot so but as he accompanied them he would say hear me today discoursing in the house of quadratus why should i hear you do you wish to show me that you put words together cleverly you put them together man and what good will it do you but only praise me what do you mean by praising say to me admirable wonderful well i say so but if that is praise whatever
 it is which philosophers mean by the name κατηγορία of good what have i to praise in you if it is good to speak well teach me and i will praise youwhat then ought a man to listen to such things without pleasurei hope not for my part i do not listen even to a luteplayer without pleasure must i then for this reason stand and play the lute hear what socrates says nor would it be seemly for a man of my age like a young man composing addresses to appear before you like a young man he says for in truth this small art is an elegant thing to select words and to put them together and to come forward and gracefully to read them or to speak and while he is reading to say there are not many who can do these things i swear by all that you value  does a philosopher invite people to hear him as the sun himself draws men to him or as food does does not the philosopher also draw to him those who will receive benefit what physician invites a man to be treated by him indeed i now hear that even the physicians in rome do invite
 patients but when i lived there the physicians were invited i invite you to come and hear that things are in a bad way for you and that you are taking care of everything except that of which you ought to take care and that you are ignorant of the good and the bad and are unfortunate and unhappy a fine kind of invitation and yet if the words of the philosopher do not produce this effect on you he is dead and so is the speaker rufus was used to say if you have leisure to praise me i am speaking to no purpose accordingly he used to speak in such a way that every one of us who were sitting there supposed that someone had accused him before rufus he so touched on what was doing he so placed before the eyes every mans faults  the philosophers school ye men is a surgery you ought not to go out of it with pleasure but with pain for you are not in sound health when you enter one has dislocated his shoulder another has an abscess a third a fistula and a fourth a headache then do i sit and utter to you little thoughts 
and exclamations that you may praise me and go away one with his shoulder in the same condition in which he entered another with his head still aching and a third with his fistula or his abscess just as they were is it for this then that young men shall quit home and leave their parents and their friends and kinsmen and property that they may say to you wonderful when you are uttering your exclamations did socrates do this or zeno or cleanthes  what then is there not the hortatory style who denies it as there is the style of refutation and the didactic style who then ever reckoned a fourth style with these the style of display what is the hortatory style to be able to show both to one person and to many the struggle in which they are engaged and that they think more about anything than about what they really wish for they wish the things which lead to happiness but they look for them in the wrong place in order that this may be done a thousand seats must be placed and men must be invited to listen and you mus
t ascend the pulpit in a fine robe or cloak and describe the death of achilles cease i entreat you by the gods to spoil good words and good acts as much as you can nothing can have more power in exhortation than when the speaker shows to the hearers that he has need of them but tell me who when he hears you reaching or discoursing is anxious about himself or turns to reflect on himself or when he has gone out says the philosopher hit me well i must no longer do these things but does he not even if you have a great reputation say to some person he spoke finely about xerxes and another says no but about the battle of thermopylae is this listening to a philosopher  xxiv that we ought not to be moved by a desire of those things which are not in our power let not that which in another is contrary to nature be an evil to you for you are not formed by nature to be depressed with others nor to be unhappy with others but to be happy with them if a man is unhappy remember that his unhappiness is his own fault for god h
as made all men to be happy to be free from perturbations for this purpose he has given means to them some things to each person as his own and other things not as his own some things subject to hindrance and compulsion and deprivation and these things are not a mans own but the things which are not subject to hindrances are his own and the nature of good and evil as it was fit to be done by him who takes care of us and protects us like a father he has made our ownbut you say i have parted from a certain person and he is grievedwhy did he consider as his own that which belongs to another why when he looked on you and was rejoiced did he not also reckon that you are mortal that it is natural for you to part from him for a foreign country therefore he suffers the consequences of his own folly but why do you or for what purpose bewail yourself is it that you also have not thought of these things but like poor women who are good for nothing you have enjoyed all things in which you took pleasure as if you would al
ways enjoy them both places and men and conversation and now you sit and weep because you do not see the same persons and do not live in the same placesindeed you deserve this to be more wretched than crows and ravens who have the power of flying where they please and changing their nests for others and crossing the seas without lamenting or regretting their former conditionyes but this happens to them because they are irrational creatureswas reason then given to us by the gods for the purpose of unhappiness and misery that we may pass our lives in wretchedness and lamentation must all persons be immortal and must no man go abroad and must we ourselves not go abroad but remain rooted like plants and if any of our familiar friends goes abroad must we sit and weep and on the contrary when he returns must we dance and clap our hands like children  shall we not now wean ourselves and remember what we have heard from the philosophers if we did not listen to them as if they were jugglers they tell us that this worl
d is one city and the substance out of which it has been formed is one and that there must be a certain period and that some things must give way to others that some must be dissolved and others come in their place some to remain in the same place and others to be moved and that all things are full of friendship first of the gods and then of men who by nature are made to be of one family and some must be with one another and others must be separated rejoicing in those who are with them and not grieving for those who are removed from them and man in addition to being by nature of a noble temper and having a contempt of all things which are not in the power of his will also possesses this property not to be rooted nor to be naturally fixed to the earth but to go at different times to different places sometimes from the urgency of certain occasions and at others merely for the sake of seeing so it was with ulysses who saw  of many men the states and learned their ways and still earlier it was the fortune of herc
ules to visit all the inhabited world  seeing mens lawless deeds and their good rules of law casting out and clearing away their lawlessness and introducing in their place good rules of law and yet how many friends do you think that he had in thebes how many in argos how many in athens and how many do you think that he gained by going about and he married also when it seemed to him a proper occasion and begot children and left them without lamenting or regretting or leaving them as orphans for he knew that no man is an orphan but it is the father who takes care of all men always and continuously for it was not as mere report that he had heard that zeus is the father of men for he thought that zeus was his own father and he called him so and to him he looked when he was doing what he did therefore he was enabled to live happily in all places and it is never possible for happiness and desire of what is not present to come together for that which is happy must have all that it desires must resemble a person who 
is filled with food and must have neither thirst nor hungerbut ulysses felt a desire for his wife and wept as he sat on a rockdo you attend to homer and his stories in everything or if ulysses really wept what was he else than an unhappy man and what good man is unhappy in truth the whole is badly administered if zeus does not take care of his own citizens that they may be happy like himself but these things are not lawful nor right to think of and if ulysses did weep and lament he was not a good man for who is good if he knows not who he is and who knows what he is if he forgets that things which have been made are perishable and that it is not possible for one human being to be with another always to desire then things which are impossible is to have a slavish character and is foolish it is the part of a stranger of a man who fights against god in the only way that he can by his opinions  but my mother laments when she does not see mewhy has she not learned these principles and i do not say this that we sho
uld not take care that she may not lament but i say that we ought not to desire in every way what is not our own and the sorrow of another is anothers sorrow but my sorrow is my own i then will stop my own sorrow by every means for it is in my power and the sorrow of another i will endeavor to stop as far as i can but i will not attempt to do it by every means for if i do i shall be fighting against god i shall be opposing zeus and shall be placing myself against him in the administration of the universe and the reward the punishment of this fighting against god and of this disobedience not only will the children of my children pay but i also shall myself both by day and by night startled by dreams perturbed trembling at every piece of news and having my tranquillity depending on the letters of otherssome person has arrived from rome i only hope that there is no harm but what harm can happen to you where you are notfrom hellas greece someone is come i hope that there is no harmin this way every place may be t
he cause of misfortune to you is it not enough for you to be unfortunate there where you are and must you be so even beyond sea and by the report of letters is this the way in which your affairs are in a state of securitywell then suppose that my friends have died in the places which are far from mewhat else have they suffered than that which is the condition of mortals or how are you desirous at the same time to live to old age and at the same time not to see the death of any person whom you love know you not that in the course of a long time many and various kinds of things must happen that a fever shall overpower one a robber another and a third a tyrant such is the condition of things around us such are those who live with us in the world cold and heat and unsuitable ways of living and journeys by land and voyages by sea and winds and various circumstances which surround us destroy one man and banish another and throw one upon an embassy and another into an army sit down then in a flutter at all these thi
ngs lamenting unhappy unfortunate dependent on another and dependent not on one or two but on ten thousands upon ten thousands  did you hear this when you were with the philosophers did you learn this do you not know that human life is a warfare that one mail must keep watch another must go out as a spy and a third must fight and it is not possible that all should be in one place nor is it better that it should be so but you neglecting to do the commands of the general complain when anything more hard than usual is imposed on you and you do not observe what you make the army become as far as it is in your power that if all imitate you no man will dig a trench no man will put a rampart round nor keep watch nor expose himself to danger but will appear to be useless for the purposes of an army again in a vessel if you go as a sailor keep to one place and stick to it and if you are ordered to climb the mast refuse if to run to the head of the ship refuse and what master of a ship will endure you and will he not p
itch you overboard as a useless thing an impediment only and bad example to the other sailors and so it is here also every mans life is a kind of warfare and it is long and diversified you must observe the duty of a soldier and do everything at the nod of the general if it is possible divining what his wishes are for there is no resemblance between that general and this neither in strength nor in superiority of character you are placed in a great office of command and not in any mean place but you are always a senator do you not know that such a man must give little time to the affairs of his household but be often away from home either as a governor or one who is governed or discharging some office or serving in war or acting as a judge then do you tell me that you wish as a plant to be fixed to the same places and to be rootedyes for it is pleasantwho says that it is not but a soup is pleasant and a handsome woman is pleasant what else do those say who make pleasure their end do you not see of what men you 
have uttered the language that it is the language of epicureans and catamites next while you are doing what they do and holding their opinions do you speak to us the words of zeno and of socrates will you not throw away as far as you can the things belonging to others with which you decorate yourself though they do not fit you at all for what else do they desire than to sleep without hindrance and free from compulsion and when they have risen to yawn at their leisure and to wash the face then write and read what they choose and then talk about some trifling matter being praised by their friends whatever they may say then to go forth for a walk and having walked about a little to bathe and then eat and sleep such sleep as is the fashion of such men why need we say how for one can easily conjecture come do you also tell your own way of passing the time which you desire you who are an admirer of truth and of socrates and diogenes what do you wish to do in athens the same that others do or something else why then
 do you call yourself a stoic well but they who falsely call themselves roman citizens are severely punished and should those who falsely claim so great and reverend a thing and name get off unpunished or is this not possible but the law divine and strong and inevitable is this which exacts the severest punishments from those who commit the greatest crimes for what does this law say let him who pretends to things which do not belong to him be a boaster a vainglorious man let him who disobeys the divine administration be base and a slave let him suffer grief let him be envious let him pity and in a word let him be unhappy and lament  well then do you wish me to pay court to a certain person to go to his doorsif reason requires this to be done for the sake of country for the sake of kinsmen for the sake of mankind why should you not go you are not ashamed to go to the doors of a shoemaker when you are in want of shoes nor to the door of a gardener when you want lettuces and are you ashamed to go to the doors of
 the rich when you want anythingyes for i have no awe of a shoemakerdont feel any awe of the richnor will i flatter the gardenerand do not flatter the richhow then shall i get what i wantdo i say to you go as if you were certain to get what you want and do not i only tell you that you may do what is becoming to yourself why then should i still go that you may have gone that you may have discharged the duty of a citizen of a brother of a friend and further remember that you have gone to the shoemaker to the seller of vegetables who have no power in anything great or noble though he may sell dear you go to buy lettuces they cost an obolus penny but not a talent so it is here also the matter is worth going for to the rich mans doorwell i will goit is worth talking aboutlet it be so i will talk with himbut you must also kiss his hand and flatter him with praiseaway with that it is a talents worth it is not profitable to me nor to the state nor to my friends to have done that which spoils a good citizen and a frie
ndbut you will seem not to have been eager about the matter if you do not succeed have you again forgotten why you went know you not that a good man does nothing for the sake of appearance but for the sake of doing rightwhat advantage is it then to him to have done rightand what advantage is it to a man who writes the name of dion to write it as he oughtthe advantage is to have written itis there no reward thendo you seek a reward for a good man greater than doing what is good and just at olympia you wish for nothing more but it seems to you enough to be crowned at the games does it seem to you so small and worthless a thing to be good and happy for these purposes being introduced by the gods into this city the world and it being now your duty to undertake the work of a man do you still want nurses also and a mamma and do foolish women by their weeping move you and make you effeminate will you thus never cease to be a foolish child know you not that he who does the acts of a child the older he is the more rid
iculous he is  in athens did you see no one by going to his housei visited any man that i pleasedhere also be ready to see and you will see whom you please only let it be without meanness neither with desire nor with aversion and your affairs will be well managed but this result does not depend on going nor on standing at the doors but it depends on what is within on your opinions when you have learned not to value things which are external and not dependent on the will and to consider that not one of them is your own but that these things only are your own to exercise the judgment well to form opinions to move towards an object to desire to turn from a thing where is there any longer room for flattery where for meanness why do you still long for the quiet there at athens and for the places to which you are accustomed wait a little and you will again find these places familiar then if you are of so ignoble a nature again if you leave these also weep and lament  how then shall i become of an affectionate tempe
r by being of a noble disposition and happy for it is not reasonable to be meanspirited nor to lament yourself nor to depend on another nor ever to blame god or man i entreat you become an affectionate person in this way by observing these rules but if through this affection as you name it you are going to be a slave and wretched there is no profit in being affectionate and what prevents you from loving another as a person subject to mortality as one who may go away from you did not socrates love his own children he did but it was as a free man as one who remembered that he must first be a friend to the gods for this reason he violated nothing which was becoming to a good man neither in making his defense nor by fixing a penalty on himself nor even in the former part of his life when he was a senator or when he was a soldier but we are fully supplied with every pretext for being of ignoble temper some for the sake of a child some for a mother and others for brethrens sake but it is not fit for us to be unhapp
y on account of any person but to be happy on account of all but chiefly on account of god who has made us for this end well did diogenes love nobody who was so kind and so much a lover of all that for mankind in general he willingly undertook so much labor and bodily sufferings he did love mankind but how as became a minister of god at the same time caring for men and being also subject to god for this reason all the earth was his country and no particular place and when he was taken prisoner he did not regret athens nor his associates and friends there but even he became familiar with the pirates and tried to improve them and being sold afterwards he lived in corinth as before at athens and he would have behaved the same if he had gone to the country of the perrhaebi thus is freedom acquired for this reason he used to say ever since antisthenes made me free i have not been a slave how did antisthenes make him free hear what he says antisthenes taught me what is my own and what is not my own possessions are 
not my own nor kinsmen domestics friends nor reputation nor places familiar nor mode of life all these belong to others what then is your own the use of appearances this he showed to me that i possess it free from hindrance and from compulsion no person can put an obstacle in my way no person can force me to use appearances otherwise than i wish who then has any power over me philip or alexander or perdiccas or the great king how have they this power for if a man is going to be overpowered by a man he must long before be overpowered by things if then pleasure is not able to subdue a man nor pain nor fame nor wealth but he is able when he chooses to spit out all his poor body in a mans face and depart from life whose slave can he still be but if he dwelt with pleasure in athens and was overpowered by this manner of life his affairs would have been at every mans command the stronger would have had the power of grieving him how do you think that diogenes would have flattered the pirates that they might sell him 
to some athenian that some time he might see that beautiful piraeus and the long walls and the acropolis in what condition would you see them as a captive a slave and mean and what would be the use of it for younot so but i should see them as a free manshow me how you would be free observe some person has caught you who leads you away from your accustomed place of abode and says you are my slave for it is in my power to hinder you from living as you please it is in my power to treat you gently and to humble you when i choose on the contrary you are cheerful and go elated to athens what do you say to him who treats you as a slave what means have you of finding one who will rescue you from slavery or cannot you even look him in the face but without saying more do you entreat to be set free man you ought to go gladly to prison hastening going before those who lead you there then i ask you are you unwilling to live in rome and desire to live in hellas greece and when you must die will you then also fill us with y
our lamentations because you will not see athens nor walk about in the lyceion have you gone abroad for this was it for this reason you have sought to find some person from whom you might receive benefit what benefit that you may solve syllogisms more readily or handle hypothotical arguments and for this reason did you leave brother country friends your family that you might return when you had learned these things so you did not go abroad to obtain constancy of mind nor freedom from perturbation nor in order that being secure from harm you may never complain of any person accuse no person and no man may wrong you and thus you may maintain your relative position without impediment this is a fine traffic that you have gone abroad for in syllogisms and sophistical arguments and hypothetical if you like take your place in the agora market or public place and proclaim them for sale like dealers in physic will you not deny even all that you have learned that you may not bring a bad name on your theorems as useless
 what harm has philosophy done you wherein has chrysippus injured you that you should prove by your acts that his labors are useless were the evils that you had there at home not enough those which were the cause of your pain and lamentation even if you had not gone abroad have you added more to the list and if you again have other acquaintances and friends you will have more causes for lamentation and the same also if you take an affection for another country why then do you live to surround yourself with other sorrows upon sorrows through which you are unhappy then i ask you do you call this affection what affection man if it is a good thing it is the cause of no evil if it is bad i have nothing to do with it i am formed by nature for my own good i am not formed for my own evil  what then is the discipline for this purpose first of all the highest and the principal and that which stands as it were at the entrance is this when you are delighted with anything be delighted as with a thing which is not one of t
hose which cannot be taken away but as with something of such a kind as an earthen pot is or a glass cup that when it has been broken you may remember what it was and may not be troubled so in this matter also if you kiss your own child or your brother or friend never give full license to the appearance φαντασίαν and allow not your pleasure to go as far as it chooses but check it and curb it as those who stand behind men in their triumphs and remind them that they are mortal do you also remind yourself in like manner that he whom you love is mortal and that what you love is nothing of your own it has been given to you for the present not that it should not be taken from you nor has it been given to you for all time but as a fig is given to you or a bunch of grapes at the appointed season of the year but if you wish for these things in winter you are a fool so if you wish for your son or friend when it is not allowed to you you must know that you are wishing for a fig in winter for such as winter is to a fig s
uch is every event which happens from the universe to the things which are taken away according to its nature and further at the times when you are delighted with a thing place before yourself the contrary appearances what harm is it while you are kissing your child to say with a lisping voice tomorrow you will die and to a friend also tomorrow you will go away or i shall and never shall we see one another againbut these are words of bad omenand some incantations also are of bad omen but because they are useful i dont care for this only let them be useful but do you call things to be of bad omen except those which are significant of some evil cowardice is a word of bad omen and meanness of spirit and sorrow and grief and shamelessness these words are of bad omen and yet we ought not to hesitate to utter them in order to protect ourselves against the things do you tell me that a name which is significant of any natural thing is of evil omen say that even for the ears of corn to be reaped is of bad omen for it 
signifies the destruction of the ears but not of the world say that the falling of the leaves also is of bad omen and for the dried fig to take the place of the green fig and for raisins to be made from the grapes for all these things are changes from a former state into other states not a destruction but a certain fixed economy and administration such is going away from home and a small change such is death a greater change not from the state which now is to that which is not but to that which is not nowshall i then no longer existyou will not exist but you will be something else of which the world now has need for you also came into existence not when you chose but when the world had need of you  wherefore the wise and good man remembering who he is and whence he came and by whom he was produced is attentive only to this how he may fill his place with due regularity and obediently to god dost thou still wish me to exist live i will continue to exist as free as noble in nature as thou hast wished me to exist
 for thou hast made me free from hindrance in that which is my own but hast thou no further need of me i thank thee and so far i have remained for thy sake and for the sake of no other person and now in obedience to thee i depart how dost thou depart again i say as thou hast pleased as free as thy servant as one who has known thy commands and thy prohibitions and so long as i shall stay in thy service whom dost thou will me to be a prince or a private man a senator or a common person a soldier or a general a teacher or a master of a family whatever place and position thou mayest assign to me as socrates says i will die ten thousand times rather than desert them and where dost thou will me to be in rome or athens or thebes or gyara only remember me there where i am if thou sendest me to a place where there are no means for men living according to nature i shall not depart from life in disobedience to thee but as if thou wast giving me the signal to retreat i do not leave thee let this be far from my intention 
but i perceive that thou hast no need of me if means of living according to nature be allowed to me i will seek no other place than that in which i am or other men than those among whom i am  let these thoughts be ready to hand by night and by day these you should write these you should read about these you should talk to yourself and to others ask a man can you help me at all for this purpose and further go to another and to another then if anything that is said be contrary to your wish this reflection first will immediately relieve you that it is not unexpected for it is a great thing in all cases to say i knew that i begot a son who is mortal for so you also will say i knew that i am mortal i knew that i may leave my home i knew that i may be ejected from it i knew that i may be led to prison then if you turn round and look to yourself and seek the place from which comes that which has happened you will forthwith recollect that it comes from the place of things which are out of the power of the will and of
 things which are not my own what then is it to me then you will ask and this is the chief thing and who is it that sent it the leader or the general the state the law of the state give it me then for i must always obey the law in everything then when the appearance of things pains you for it is not in your power to prevent this contend against it by the aid of reason conquer it do not allow it to gain strength nor to lead you to the consequences by raising images such as it pleases and as it pleases if you be in gyara do not imagine the mode of living at rome and how many pleasures there were for him who lived there and how many there would be for him who returned to rome but fix your mind on this matter how a man who lives in gyara ought to live in gyara like a man of courage and if you be in rome do not imagine what the life in athens is but think only of the life in rome  then in the place of all other delights substitute this that of being conscious that you are obeying god that not in word but in deed y
ou are performing the acts of a wise and good man for what a thing it is for a man to be able to say to himself now whatever the rest may say in solemn manner in the schools and may be judged to be saying in a way contrary to common opinion or in a strange way this i am doing and they are sitting and are discoursing of my virtues and inquiring about me and praising me and of this zeus has willed that i shall receive from myself a demonstration and shall myself know if he has a soldier such as he ought to have a citizen such as he ought to have and if he has chosen to produce me to the rest of mankind as a witness of the things which are independent of the will see that you fear without reason that you foolishly desire what you do desire seek not the good in things external seek it in yourselves if you do not you will not find it for this purpose he leads me at one time hither at another time sends me thither shows me to men as poor without authority and sick sends me to gyara leads me into prison not because 
he hates me far from him be such a meaning for who hates the best of his servants nor yet because he cares not for me for he does not neglect any even of the smallest things but he does this for the purpose of exercising me and making use of me as a witness to others being appointed to such a service do i still care about the place in which i am or with whom i am or what men say about me and do i not entirely direct my thoughts to god and to his instructions and commands  having these things or thoughts always in hand and exercising them by yourself and keeping them in readiness you will never be in want of one to comfort you and strengthen you for it is not shameful to be without something to eat but not to have reason sufficient for keeping away fear and sorrow but if once you have gained exemption from sorrow and fear will there any longer be a tyrant for you or a tyrants guard or attendants on caesar or shall any appointment to offices at court cause you pain or shall those who sacrifice in the capitol on
 the occasion of being named to certain functions cause pain to you who have received so great authority from zeus only do not make a proud display of it nor boast of it but show it by your acts and if no man perceives it be satisfied that you are yourself in a healthy state and happy  xxv to those who fall off desist from their purpose consider as to the things which you proposed to yourself at first which you have secured and which you have not and how you are pleased when you recall to memory the one and are pained about the other and if it is possible recover the things wherein you failed for we must not shrink when we are engaged in the greatest combat but we must even take blows for the combat before us is not in wrestling and the pancration in which both the successful and the unsuccessful may have the greatest merit or may have little and in truth may be very fortunate or very unfortunate but the combat is for good fortune and happiness themselves well then even if we have renounced the contest in thi
s matter for good fortune and happiness no man hinders us from renewing the combat again and we are not compelled to wait for another four years that the games at olympia may come again but as soon as you have recovered and restored yourself and employ the same zeal you may renew the combat again and if again you renounce it you may again renew it and if you once gain the victory you are like him who has never renounced the combat only do not through a habit of doing the same thing renouncing the combat begin to do it with pleasure and then like a bad athlete go about after being conquered in all the circuit of the games like quails who have run away  the sight of a beautiful young girl overpowers me well have i not been overpowered before an inclination arises in me to find fault with a person for have i not found fault with him before you speak to us as if you had come off from these things free from harm just as if a man should say to his physician who forbids him to bathe have i not bathed before if then 
the physician can say to him well and what then happened to you after the bath had you not a fever had you not a headache and when you found fault with a person lately did you not do the act of a malignant person of a trifling babbler did you not cherish this habit in you by adding to it the corresponding acts and when you were overpowered by the young girl did you come off unharmed why then do you talk of what you did before you ought i think remembering what you did as slaves remember the blows which they have received to abstain from the same faults but the one case is not like the other for in the case of slaves the pain causes the remembrance but in the case of your faults what is the pain what is the punishment for when have you been accustomed to fly from evil acts sufferings then of the trying character are useful to us whether we choose or not  xxvi to those who fear want are you not ashamed at being more cowardly and more mean than fugitive slaves how do they when they run away leave their masters o
n what estates do they depend and what domestics do they rely on do they not after stealing a little which is enough for the first days then afterwards move on through land or through sea contriving one method after another for maintaining their lives and what fugitive slave ever died of hunger but you are afraid lest necessary things should fail you and are sleepless by night wretch are you so blind and dont you see the road to which the want of necessaries leadswell where does it leadto the same place to which a fever leads or a stone that falls on you to death have you not often said this yourself to your companions have you not read much of this kind and written much and how often have you boasted that you were easy as to death  yes but my wife and children also suffer hungerwell then does their hunger lead to any other place is there not the same descent to some place for them also is not there the same state below for them do you not choose then to look to that place full of boldness against every want 
and deficiency to that place to which both the richest and those who have held the highest offices and kings themselves and tyrants must descend or to which you will descend hungry if it should so happen but they burst by indigestion and drunkenness what beggar did you hardly ever see who was not an old man and even of extreme old age but chilled with cold day and night and lying on the ground and eating only what is absolutely necessary they approach near to the impossibility of dying cannot you write cannot you teach take care of children cannot you be a watchman at another persons doorbut it is shameful to come to such a necessitylearn then first what are the things which are shameful and then tell us that you are a philosopher but at present do not even if any other man call you so allow it  is that shameful to you which is not your own act that of which you are not the cause that which has come to you by accident as a headache as a fever if your parents were poor and left their property to others and if 
while they live they do not help you at all is this shameful to you is this what you learned with the philosophers did you never hear that the thing which is shameful ought to be blamed and that which is blameable is worthy of blame whom do you blame for an act which is not his own which he did not do himself did you then make your father such as he is or is it in your power to improve him is this power given to you well then ought you to wish the things which are not given to you or to be ashamed if you do not obtain them and have you also been accustomed while you were studying philosophy to look to others and to hope for nothing from yourself lament then and groan and eat with fear that you may not have food tomorrow tremble about your poor slaves lest they steal lest they run away lest they die so live and continue to live you who in name only have approached philosophy and have disgraced its theorems as far as you can by showing them to be useless and unprofitable to those who take them up you who have n
ever sought constancy freedom from perturbation and from passions you who have not sought any person for the sake of this object but many for the sake of syllogisms you who have never thoroughly examined any of these appearances by yourself am i able to bear or am i not able to bear what remains for me to do but as if all your affairs were well and secure you have been resting on the third topic that of things being unchanged in order that you may possess unchangedwhat cowardice mean spirit the admiration of the rich desire without attaining any end and avoidance ἔκκλισιν which fails in the attempt about security in these things you have been anxious  ought you not to have gained something in addition from reason and then to have protected this with security and whom did you ever see building a battlement all round and not encircling it with a wall and what doorkeeper is placed with no door to watch but you practice in order to be able to provewhat you practice that you may not be tossed as on the sea through
 sophisms and tossed about from what show me first what you hold what you measure or what you weigh and show me the scales or the medimnus the measure or how long will you go on measuring the dust ought you not to demonstrate those things which make men happy which make things go on for them in the way as they wish and why we ought to blame no man accuse no man and acquiesce in the administration of the universe show me these see i show them i will resolve syllogisms for youthis is the measure slave but it is not the thing measured therefore you are now paying the penalty for what you neglected philosophy you tremble you lie awake you advise with all persons and if your deliberations are not likely to please all you think that you have deliberated ill then you fear hunger as you suppose but it is not hunger that you fear but you are afraid that you will not have a cook that you will not have another to purchase provisions for the table a third to take off your shoes a fourth to dress you others to rub you and
 to follow you in order that in the bath when you have taken off your clothes and stretched yourself out like those who are crucified you may be rubbed on this side and on that and then the aliptes rubber may say to the slave change his position present the side take hold of his head show the shoulder and then when you have left the bath and gone home you may call out does no one bring something to eat and then take away the tables sponge them you are afraid of this that you may not be able to lead the life of a sick man but learn the life of those who are in health how slaves live how laborers how those live who are genuine philosophers how socrates lived who had a wife and children how diogenes lived and how cleanthes who attended to the school and drew water if you choose to have these things you will have them everywhere and you will live in full confidence confiding in what in that alone in which a man can confide in that which is secure in that which is not subject to hindrance in that which cannot be t
aken away that is in your own will and why have you made yourself so useless and good for nothing that no man will choose to receive you into his house no man to take care of you but if a utensil entire and useful were cast abroad every man who found it would take it up and think it a gain but no man will take you up and every man will consider you a loss so cannot you discharge the office even of a dog or of a cock why then do you choose to live any longer when you are what you are  does any good man fear that he shall fail to have food to the blind it does not fail to the lame it does not shall it fail to a good man and to a good soldier there does not fail to be one who gives him pay nor to a laborer nor to a shoemaker and to the good man shall there be wanting such a person does god thus neglect the things that he has established his ministers his witnesses whom alone he employs as examples to the uninstructed both that he exists and administers well the whole and does not neglect human affairs and that t
o a good man there is no evil either when he is living or when he is dead what then when he does not supply him with food what else does he do than like a good general he has given me the signal to retreat i obey i follow assenting to the words of the commander praising his acts for i came when it pleased him and i will also go away when it pleases him and while i lived it was my duty to praise god both by myself and to each person severally and to many he does not supply me with many things nor with abundance he does not will me to live luxuriously for neither did he supply hercules who was his own son but another eurystheus was king of argos and mycenae and hercules obeyed orders and labored and was exercised and eurystheus was what he was neither king of argos nor of mycenae for he was not even king of himself but hercules was ruler and leader of the whole earth and sea who purged away lawlessness and introduced justice and holiness and he did these things both naked and alone and when ulysses was cast out
 shipwrecked did want humiliate him did it break his spirit but how did he go off to the virgins to ask for necessaries to beg which is considered most shameful  as a lion bred in the mountains trusting in his strength odyssey vi  relying on what not on reputation nor on wealth nor on the power of a magistrate but on his own strength that is on his opinions about the things which are in our power and those which are not for these are the only things which make men free which make them escape from hindrance which raise the head neck of those who are depressed which make them look with steady eyes on the rich and on tyrants and this was is the gift given to the philosopher but you will not come forth bold but trembling about your trifling garments and silver vessels unhappy man have you thus wasted your time till now  what then if i shall be sick you will be sick in such a way as you ought to bewho will take care of megod your friendsi shall lie down on a hard bedbut you will lie down like a mani shall not have
 a convenient chamberyou will be sick in an inconvenient chamberwho will provide for me the necessary foodthose who provide for others also you will be sick like manesand what also will be the end of the sickness any other than deathdo you then consider that this the chief of all evils to man and the chief mark of mean spirit and of cowardice is not death but rather the fear of death against this fear then i advise you to exercise yourself to this let all your reasoning tend your exercises and reading and you will know that thus only are men made free  book iv i about freedom he is free who lives as he wishes to live who is neither subject to compulsion nor to hindrance nor to force whose movements to action ὁρμαί are not impeded whose desires attain their purpose and who does not fall into that which he would avoid ἐκκλίσεις ἀπερίπτωτοι who then chooses to live in error no man who chooses to live deceived liable to mistake unjust unrestrained discontented mean no man not one then of the bad lives as he wishe
s nor is he then free and who chooses to live in sorrow fear envy pity desiring and failing in his desires attempting to avoid something and falling into it not one do we then find any of the bad free from sorrow free from fear who does not fall into that which he would avoid and does not obtain that which he wishes not one nor then do we find any bad man free  if then a man who has been twice consul should hear this if you add but you are a wise man this is nothing to you he will pardon you but if you tell him the truth and say you differ not at all from those who have been thrice sold as to being yourself not a slave what else ought you to expect than blows for he says what i a slave i whose father was free whose mother was free i whom no man can purchase i am also of senatorial rank and a friend of caesar and i have been a consul and i own many slavesin the first place most excellent senatorial man perhaps your father also was a slave in the same kind of servitude and your mother and your grandfather and a
ll your ancestors in an ascending series but even if they were as free as it is possible what is this to you what if they were of a noble nature and you of a mean nature if they were fearless and you a coward if they had the power of selfrestraint and you are not able to exercise it  and what you may say has this to do with being a slave does it seem to you to be nothing to do a thing unwillingly with compulsion with groans has this nothing to do with being a slave it is something you say but who is able to compel me except the lord of all caesar then even you yourself have admitted that you have one master but that he is the common master of all as you say let not this console you at all but know that you are a slave in a great family so also the people of nicopolis are used to exclaim by the fortune of caesar we are free  however if you please let us not speak of caesar at present but tell me this did you never love any person a young girl or slave or free what then is this with respect to being a slave or 
free were you never commanded by the person beloved to do something which you did not wish to do have you never flattered your little slave have you never kissed her feet and yet if any man compelled you to kiss caesars feet you would think it an insult and excessive tyranny what else then is slavery did you never go out by night to some place whither you did not wish to go did you not expend that you did not wish to expend did you not utter words with sighs and groans did you not submit to abuse and to be excluded but if you are ashamed to confess your own acts see what thrasonides says and does who having seen so much military service as perhaps not even you have first of all went out by night when geta a slave does not venture out but if he were compelled by his master would have cried out much and would have gone out lamenting his bitter slavery next what does thrasonides say a worthless girl has enslaved me me whom no enemy ever did unhappy man who are the slave even of a girl and a worthless girl why th
en do you still call yourself free and why do you talk of your service in the army then he calls for a sword and is angry with him who out of kindness refuses it and he sends presents to her who hates him and entreats and weeps and on the other hand having had a little success he is elated but even then how was he free enough neither to desire nor to fear  now consider in the case of animals how we employ the notion of liberty men keep tame lions shut up and feed them and some take them about and who will say that this lion is free is it not the fact that the more he lives at his ease so much the more he is in a slavish condition and who if he had perception and reason would wish to be one of these lions well these birds when they are caught and are kept shut up how much do they suffer in their attempts to escape and some of them die of hunger rather than submit to such a kind of life and as many of them as live hardly live and with suffering pine away and if they ever find any opening they make their escape 
so much do they desire their natural liberty and to be independent and free from hindrance and what harm is there to you in this what do you say i am formed by nature to fly where i choose to live in the open air to sing when i choose you deprive me of all this and say what harm is it to you for this reason we shall say that those animals only are free which cannot endure capture but as soon as they are caught escape from captivity by death so diogenes also somewhere says that there is only one way to freedom and that is to die content and he writes to the persian king you cannot enslave the athenian state any more than you can enslave fishes how is that cannot i catch them if you catch them says diogenes they will immediately leave you as fishes do for if you catch a fish it dies and if these men that are caught shall die of what use to you is the preparation for war these are the words of a free man who had carefully examined the thing and as was natural had discovered it but if you look for it in a differe
nt place from where it is what wonder if you never find it  the slave wishes to be set free immediately why do you think that he wishes to pay money to the collectors of twentieths no but because he imagines that hitherto through not having obtained this he is hindered and unfortunate if i shall be set free immediately it is all happiness i care for no man i speak to all as an equal and like to them i go where i choose i come from any place i choose and go where i choose then he is set free and forthwith having no place where he can eat he looks for some man to flatter someone with whom he shall sup then he either works with his body and endures the most dreadful things and if he can obtain a manger he falls into a slavery much worse than his former slavery or even if he is become rich being a man without any knowledge of what is good he loves some little girl and in his unhappiness laments and desires to be a slave again he says what evil did i suffer in my state of slavery another clothed me another supplie
d me with shoes another fed me another looked after me in sickness and i did only a few services for him but now a wretched man what things i suffer being a slave to many instead of to one but however he says if i shall acquire rings then i shall live most prosperously and happily first in order to acquire these rings he submits to that which he is worthy of then when he has acquired them it is again all the same then he says if i shall be engaged in military service i am free from all evils he obtains military service he suffers as much as a flogged slave and nevertheless he asks for a second service and a third after this when he has put the finishing stroke the colophon to his career and is become a senator then he becomes a slave by entering into the assembly then he serves the finer and most splendid slaverynot to be a fool but to learn what socrates taught what is the nature of each thing that exists and that a man should not rashly adapt preconceptions προλήψεις to the several things which are for this
 is the cause to men of all their evils the not being able to adapt the general preconceptions to the several things but we have different opinions about the cause of our evils one man thinks that he is sick not so however but the fact is that he does not adapt his preconceptions right another thinks that he is poor another that he has a severe father or mother and another again that caesar is not favorable to him but all this is one and only one thing the not knowing how to adapt the preconceptions for who has not a preconception of that which is bad that it is hurtful that it ought to be avoided that it ought in every way to be guarded against one preconception is not repugnant to another only where it comes to the matter of adaptation what then is this evil which is both hurtful and a thing to be avoided he answers not to be caesars friendhe is gone far from the mark he has missed the adaptation he is embarrassed he seeks the things which are not at all pertinent to the matter for when he has succeeded in 
being caesars friend nevertheless he has failed in finding what he sought for what is that which every man seeks to live secure to be happy to do everything as he wishes not to be hindered nor compelled when then he is become the friend of caesar is he free from hindrance free from compulsion is he tranquil is he happy of whom shall we inquire what more trustworthy witness have we than this very man who is become caesars friend come forward and tell us when did you sleep more quietly now or before you became caesars friend immediately you hear the answer stop i entreat you and do not mock me you know not what miseries i suffer and sleep does not come to me but one comes and says caesar is already awake he is now going forth then come troubles and careswell when did you sup with more pleasure now or before hear what he says about this also he says that if he is not invited he is pained and if he is invited he sups like a slave with his master all the while being anxious that he does not say or do anything fool
ish and what do you suppose that he is afraid of lest he should be lashed like a slave how can he expect anything so good no but as befits so great a man caesars friend he is afraid that he may lose his head and when did you bathe more free from trouble and take your gymnastic exercise more quietly in fine which kind of life did you prefer your present or your former life i can swear that no man is so stupid or so ignorant of truth as not to bewail his own misfortunes the nearer he is in friendship to caesar since then neither those who are called kings live as they choose nor the friends of kings who finally are those who are free seek and you will find for you have aids from nature for the discovery of truth but if you are not able yourself by going along these ways only to discover that which follows listen to those who have made the inquiry what do they say does freedom seem to you a good thing the greatest good is it possible then that he who obtains the greatest good can be unhappy or fare badly no whom
soever then you shall see unhappy unfortunate lamenting confidently declare that they are not free i do declare it we have now then got away from buying and selling and from such arrangements about matters of property for if you have rightly assented to these matters if the great king the persian king is unhappy he cannot be free nor can a little king nor a man of consular rank nor one who has been twice consulbe it so  further then answer me this question also does freedom seem to you to be something great and noble and valuablehow should it not seem so is it possible then when a man obtains anything so great and valuable and noble to be meanit is not possiblewhen then you see any man subject to another or flattering him contrary to his own opinion confidently affirm that this man also is not free and not only if he do this for a bit of supper but also if he does it for a government province or a consulship and call these men little slaves who for the sake of little matters do these things and those who do s
o for the sake of great things call great slaves as they deserve to bethis is admitted alsodo you think that freedom is a thing independent and selfgoverningcertainlywhomsoever then it is in the power of another to hinder and compel declare that he is not free and do not look i entreat you after his grandfathers and great grandfathers or inquire about his being bought or sold but if you hear him saying from his heart and with feeling master even if the twelve fasces precede him as consul call him a slave and if you hear him say wretch that i am how much i suffer call him a slave if finally you see him lamenting complaining unhappy call him a slave though he wears a praetexta if then he is doing nothing of this kind do not yet say that he is free but learn his opinions whether they are subject to compulsion or may produce hindrance or to bad fortune and if you find him such call him a slave who has a holiday in the saturnalia say that his master is from home he will return soon and you will know what he suffer
