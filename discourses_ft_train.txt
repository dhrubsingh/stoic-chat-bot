book i i of the things which are in our power and not in our power of all the faculties except that which i shall soon mention you will find not one which is capable of contemplating itself and consequently not capable either of approving or disapproving how far does the grammatic art possess the contemplating power as far as forming a judgment about what is written and spoken and how far music as far as judging about melody does either of them then contemplate itself by no means but when you must write something to your friend grammar will tell you what words you should write but whether you should write or not grammar will not tell you and so it is with music as to musical sounds but whether you should sing at the present time and play on the lute or do neither music will not tell you what faculty then will tell you that which contemplates both itself and all other things and what is this faculty the rational faculty for this is the only faculty that we have received which examines itself what it is and wha
t power it has and what is the value of this gift and examines all other faculties for what else is there which tells us that golden things are beautiful for they do not say so themselves evidently it is the faculty which is capable of judging of appearances what else judges of music grammar and the other faculties proves their uses and points out the occasions for using them nothing else  as then it was fit to be so that which is best of all and supreme over all is the only thing which the gods have placed in our power the right use of appearances but all other things they have not placed in our power was it because they did not choose i indeed think that if they had been able they would have put these other things also in our power but they certainly could not for as we exist on the earth and are bound to such a body and to such companions how was it possible for us not to be hindered as to these things by externals  but what says zeus epictetus if it were possible i would have made both your little body an
d your little property free and not exposed to hindrance but now be not ignorant of this this body is not yours but it is clay finely tempered and since i was not able to do for you what i have mentioned i have given you a small portion of us this faculty of pursuing an object and avoiding it and the faculty of desire and aversion and in a word the faculty of using the appearances of things and if you will take care of this faculty and consider it your only possession you will never be hindered never meet with impediments you will not lament you will not blame you will not flatter any person  well do these seem to you small matters i hope not be content with them then and pray to the gods but now when it is in our power to look after one thing and to attach ourselves to it we prefer to look after many things and to be bound to many things to the body and to property and to brother and to friend and to child and to slave since then we are bound to many things we are depressed by them and dragged down for this 
reason when the weather is not fit for sailing we sit down and torment ourselves and continually look out to see what wind is blowing it is north what is that to us when will the west wind blow when it shall choose my good man or when it shall please aeolus for god has not made you the manager of the winds but aeolus what then we must make the best use that we can of the things which are in our power and use the rest according to their nature what is their nature then as god may please  must i then alone have my head cut off what would you have all men lose their heads that you may be consoled will you not stretch out your neck as lateranus did at rome when nero ordered him to be beheaded for when he had stretched out his neck and received a feeble blow which made him draw it in for a moment he stretched it out again and a little before when he was visited by epaphroditus neros freedman who asked him about the cause of offense which he had given he said if i choose to tell anything i will tell your master  wh
at then should a man have in readiness in such circumstances what else than this what is mine and what is not mine and what is permitted to me and what is not permitted to me i must die must i then die lamenting i must be put in chains must i then also lament i must go into exile does any man then hinder me from going with smiles and cheerfulness and contentment tell me the secret which you possess i will not for this is in my power but i will put you in chains man what are you talking about me in chains you may fetter my leg but my will not even zeus himself can overpower i will throw you into prison my poor body you mean i will cut your head off when then have i told you that my head alone cannot be cut off these are the things which philosophers should meditate on which they should write daily in which they should exercise themselves  thrasea used to say i would rather be killed today than banished tomorrow what then did rufus say to him if you choose death as the heavier misfortune how great is the folly 
of your choice but if as the lighter who has given you the choice will you not study to be content with that which has been given to you  what then did agrippinus say he said i am not a hindrance to myself when it was reported to him that his trial was going on in the senate he said i hope it may turn out well but it is the fifth hour of the daythis was the time when he was used to exercise himself and then take the cold bathlet us go and take our exercise after he had taken his exercise one comes and tells him you have been condemned to banishment he replies or to death to banishment what about my property it is not taken from you let us go to aricia then he said and dine  this it is to have studied what a man ought to study to have made desire aversion free from hindrance and free from all that a man would avoid i must die if now i am ready to die if after a short time i now dine because it is the dinnerhour after this i will then die how like a man who gives up what belongs to another  ii how a man on ever
y occasion can maintain his proper character to the rational animal only is the irrational intolerable but that which is rational is tolerable blows are not naturally intolerable how is that see how the lacedaemonians endure whipping when they have learned that whipping is consistent with reason to hang yourself is not intolerable when then you have the opinion that it is rational you go and hang yourself in short if we observe we shall find that the animal man is pained by nothing so much as by that which is irrational and on the contrary attracted to nothing so much as to that which is rational  but the rational and the irrational appear such in a different way to different persons just as the good and the bad the profitable and the unprofitable for this reason particularly we need discipline in order to learn how to adapt the preconception of the rational and the irrational to the several things conformably to nature but in order to determine the rational and the irrational we use not only the estimates of
 external things but we consider also what is appropriate to each person for to one man it is consistent with reason to hold a chamber pot for another and to look to this only that if he does not hold it he will receive stripes and he will not receive his food but if he shall hold the pot he will not suffer anything hard or disagreeable but to another man not only does the holding of a chamber pot appear intolerable for himself but intolerable also for him to allow another to do this office for him if then you ask me whether you should hold the chamber pot or not i shall say to you that the receiving of food is worth more than the not receiving of it and the being scourged is a greater indignity than not being scourged so that if you measure your interests by these things go and hold the chamber pot but this you say would not be worthy of me well then it is you who must introduce this consideration into the inquiry not i for it is you who know yourself how much you are worth to yourself and at what price you 
sell yourself for men sell themselves at various prices  for this reason when florus was deliberating whether he should go down to neros spectacles and also perform in them himself agrippinus said to him go down and when florus asked agrippinus why do not you go down agrippinus replied because i do not even deliberate about the matter for he who has once brought himself to deliberate about such matters and to calculate the value of external things comes very near to those who have forgotten their own character for why do you ask me the question whether death is preferable or life i say life pain or pleasure i say pleasure but if i do not take a part in the tragic acting i shall have my head struck off go then and take a part but i will not why because you consider yourself to be only one thread of those which are in the tunic well then it was fitting for you to take care how you should be like the rest of men just as the thread has no design to be anything superior to the other threads but i wish to be purple
 that small part which is bright and makes all the rest appear graceful and beautiful why then do you tell me to make myself like the many and if i do how shall i still be purple  priscus helvidius also saw this and acted conformably for when vespasian sent and commanded him not to go into the senate he replied it is in your power not to allow me to be a member of the senate but so long as i am i must go in well go in then says the emperor but say nothing do not ask my opinion and i will be silent but i must ask your opinion and i must say what i think right but if you do i shall put you to death when then did i tell you that i am immortal you will do your part and i will do mine it is your part to kill it is mine to die but not in fear yours to banish me mine to depart without sorrow  what good then did priscus do who was only a single person and what good does the purple do for the toga why what else than this that it is conspicuous in the toga as purple and is displayed also as a fine example to all other 
things but in such circumstances another would have replied to caesar who forbade him to enter the senate i thank you for sparing me but such a man vespasian would not even have forbidden to enter the senate for he knew that he would either sit there like an earthen vessel or if he spoke he would say what caesar wished and add even more  in this way an athlete also acted who was in danger of dying unless his private parts were amputated his brother came to the athlete who was a philosopher and said come brother what are you going to do shall we amputate this member and return to the gymnasium but the athlete persisted in his resolution and died when someone asked epictetus how he did this as an athlete or a philosopher as a man epictetus replied and a man who had been proclaimed among the athletes at the olympic games and had contended in them a man who had been familiar with such a place and not merely anointed in batons school another would have allowed even his head to be cut off if he could have lived wit
hout it such is that regard to character which is so strong in those who have been accustomed to introduce it of themselves and conjoined with other things into their deliberations  come then epictetus shave yourself if i am a philosopher i answer i will not shave myself but i will take off your head if that will do you any good take it off  some person asked how then shall every man among us perceive what is suitable to his character how he replied does the bull alone when the lion has attacked discover his own powers and put himself forward in defense of the whole herd it is plain that with the powers the perception of having them is immediately conjoined and therefore whoever of us has such powers will not be ignorant of them now a bull is not made suddenly nor a brave man but we must discipline ourselves in the winter for the summer campaign and not rashly run upon that which does not concern us  only consider at what price you sell your own will if for no other reason at least for this that you sell it n
ot for a small sum but that which is great and superior perhaps belongs to socrates and such as are like him why then if we are naturally such are not a very great number of us like him is it true then that all horses become swift that all dogs are skilled in tracking footprints what then since i am naturally dull shall i for this reason take no pains i hope not epictetus is not superior to socrates but if he is not inferior this is enough for me for i shall never be a milo and yet i do not neglect my body nor shall i be a croesus and yet i do not neglect my property nor in a word do we neglect looking after anything because we despair of reaching the highest degree  iii how a man should proceed from the principle of god being the father of all men to the rest if a man should be able to assent to this doctrine as he ought that we are all sprung from god in an especial manner and that god is the father both of men and of gods i suppose that he would never have any ignoble or mean thoughts about himself but if 
caesar the emperor should adopt you no one could endure your arrogance and if you know that you are the son of zeus will you not be elated yet we do not so but since these two things are mingled in the generation of man body in common with the animals and reason and intelligence in common with the gods many incline to this kinship which is miserable and mortal and some few to that which is divine and happy since then it is of necessity that every man uses everything according to the opinion which he has about it those the few who think that they are formed for fidelity and modesty and a sure use of appearances have no mean or ignoble thoughts about themselves but with the many it is quite the contrary for they say what am i a poor miserable man with my wretched bit of flesh wretched indeed but you possess something better than your bit of flesh why then do you neglect that which is better and why do you attach yourself to this  through this kinship with the flesh some of us inclining to it become like wolves 
faithless and treacherous and mischievous some become like lions savage and bestial and untamed but the greater part of us become foxes and other worse animals for what else is a slanderer and a malignant man than a fox or some other more wretched and meaner animal see then and take care that you do not become some one of these miserable things  iv of progress or improvement he who is making progress having learned from philosophers that desire means the desire of good things and aversion means aversion from bad things having learned too that happiness and tranquillity are not attainable by man otherwise than by not failing to obtain what he desires and not falling into that which he would avoid such a man takes from himself desire altogether and defers it but he employs his aversion only on things which are dependent on his will for if he attempts to avoid anything independent of his will he knows that sometimes he will fall in with something which he wishes to avoid and he will be unhappy now if virtue prom
ises good fortune and tranquillity and happiness certainly also the progress towards virtue is progress towards each of these things for it is always true that to whatever point the perfecting of anything leads us progress is an approach towards this point  how then do we admit that virtue is such as i have said and yet seek progress in other things and make a display of it what is the product of virtue tranquillity who then makes improvement is it he who has read many books of chrysippus but does virtue consist in having understood chrysippus if this is so progress is clearly nothing else than knowing a great deal of chrysippus but now we admit that virtue produces one thing and we declare that approaching near to it is another thing namely progress or improvement such a person says one is already able to read chrysippus by himself indeed sir you are making great progress what kind of progress but why do you mock the man why do you draw him away from the perception of his own misfortunes will you not show hi
m the effect of virtue that he may learn where to look for improvement seek it there wretch where your work lies and where is your work in desire and in aversion that you may not be disappointed in your desire and that you may not fall into that which you would avoid in your pursuit and avoiding that you commit no error in assent and suspension of assent that you be not deceived the first things and the most necessary are those which i have named but if with trembling and lamentation you seek not to fall into that which you avoid tell me how you are improving  do you then show me your improvement in these things if i were talking to an athlete i should say show me your shoulders and then he might say here are my halteres you and your halteres look to that i should reply i wish to see the effect of the halteres so when you say take the treatise on the active powers ὁρμή and see how i have studied it i reply slave i am not inquiring about this but how you exercise pursuit and avoidance desire and aversion how y
ou design and purpose and prepare yourself whether conformably to nature or not if conformably give me evidence of it and i will say that you are making progress but if not conformably be gone and not only expound your books but write such books yourself and what will you gain by it do you not know that the whole book costs only five denarii does then the expounder seem to be worth more than five denarii never then look for the matter itself in one place and progress towards it in another  where then is progress if any of you withdrawing himself from externals turns to his own will προαίρεσις to exercise it and to improve it by labor so as to make it conformable to nature elevated free unrestrained unimpeded faithful modest and if he has learned that he who desires or avoids the things which are not in his power can neither be faithful nor free but of necessity he must change with them and be tossed about with them as in a tempest and of necessity must subject himself to others who have the power to procure o
r prevent what he desires or would avoid finally when he rises in the morning if he observes and keeps these rules bathes as a man of fidelity eats as a modest man in like manner if in every matter that occurs he works out his chief principles τὰ προηγούμενα as the runner does with reference to running and the trainer of the voice with reference to the voicethis is the man who truly makes progress and this is the man who has not travelled in vain but if he has strained his efforts to the practice of reading books and labors only at this and has travelled for this i tell him to return home immediately and not to neglect his affairs there for this for which he has travelled is nothing but the other thing is something to study how a man can rid his life of lamentation and groaning and saying woe to me and wretched that i am and to rid it also of misfortune and disappointment and to learn what death is and exile and prison and poison that he may be able to say when he is in fetters dear crito if it is the will of
 the gods that it be so let it be so and not to say wretched am i an old man have i kept my grey hairs for this who is it that speaks thus do you think that i shall name some man of no repute and of low condition does not priam say this does not oedipus say this nay all kings say it for what else is tragedy than the perturbations πάθη of men who value externals exhibited in this kind of poetry but if a man must learn by fiction that no external things which are independent of the will concern us for my part i should like this fiction by the aid of which i should live happily and undisturbed but you must consider for yourselves what you wish  what then does chrysippus teach us the reply is to know that these things are not false from which happiness comes and tranquillity arises take my books and you will learn how true and conformable to nature are the things which make me free from perturbations o great good fortune o the great benefactor who points out the way to triptolemus all men have erected temples and
 altars because he gave us food by cultivation but to him who discovered truth and brought it to light and communicated it to all not the truth which shows us how to live but how to live well who of you for this reason has built an altar or a temple or has dedicated a statue or who worships god for this because the gods have given the vine or wheat we sacrifice to them but because they have produced in the human mind that fruit by which they designed to show us the truth which relates to happiness shall we not thank god for this  v against the academics if a man said epictetus opposes evident truths it is not easy to find arguments by which we shall make him change his opinion but this does not arise either from the mans strength or the teachers weakness for when the man though he has been confuted is hardened like a stone how shall we then be able to deal with him by argument  now there are two kinds of hardening one of the understanding the other of the sense of shame when a man is resolved not to assent to
 what is manifest nor to desist from contradictions most of us are afraid of mortification of the body and would contrive all means to avoid such a thing but we care not about the souls mortification and indeed with regard to the soul if a man be in such a state as not to apprehend anything or understand at all we think that he is in a bad condition but if the sense of shame and modesty are deadened this we call even power or strength  do you comprehend that you are awake i do not the man replies for i do not even comprehend when in my sleep i imagine that i am awake does this appearance then not differ from the other not at all he replies shall i still argue with this man and what fire or what iron shall i apply to him to make him feel that he is deadened he does perceive but he pretends that he does not he is even worse than a dead man he does not see the contradiction he is in a bad condition another does see it but he is not moved and makes no improvement he is even in a worse condition his modesty is ext
irpated and his sense of shame and the rational faculty has not been cut off from him but it is brutalised shall i name this strength of mind certainly not unless we also name it such in catamites through which they do and say in public whatever comes into their head  vi of providence from everything which is or happens in the world it is easy to praise providence if a man possesses these two qualities the faculty of seeing what belongs and happens to all persons and things and a grateful disposition if he does not possess these two qualities one man will not see the use of things which are and which happen another will not be thankful for them even if he does know them if god had made colors but had not made the faculty of seeing them what would have been their use none at all on the other hand if he had made the faculty of vision but had not made objects such as to fall under the faculty what in that case also would have been the use of it none at all well suppose that he had made both but had not made ligh
t in that case also they would have been of no use who is it then who has fitted this to that and that to this and who is it that has fitted the knife to the case and the case to the knife is it no one and indeed from the very structure of things which have attained their completion we are accustomed to show that the work is certainly the act of some artificer and that it has not been constructed without a purpose does then each of these things demonstrate the workman and do not visible things and the faculty of seeing and light demonstrate him and the existence of male and female and the desire of each for conjunction and the power of using the parts which are constructed do not even these declare the workman if they do not let us consider the constitution of our understanding according to which when we meet with sensible objects we do not simply receive impressions from them but we also select something from them and subtract something and add and compound by means of them these things or those and in fact 
pass from some to other things which in a manner resemble them is not even this sufficient to move some men and to induce them not to forget the workman if not so let them explain to us what it is that makes each several thing or how it is possible that things so wonderful and like the contrivances of art should exist by chance and from their own proper motion  what then are these things done in us only many indeed in us only of which the rational animal had peculiarly need but you will find many common to us with irrational animals do they then understand what is done by no means for use is one thing and understanding is another god had need of irrational animals to make use of appearances but of us to understand the use of appearances it is therefore enough for them to eat and to drink and to sleep and to copulate and to do all the other things which they severally do but for us to whom he has given also the intellectual faculty these things are not sufficient for unless we act in a proper and orderly manne
r and conformably to the nature and constitution of each thing we shall never attain our true end for where the constitutions of living beings are different there also the acts and the ends are different in those animals then whose constitution is adapted only to use use alone is enough but in an animal man which has also the power of understanding the use unless there be the due exercise of the understanding he will never attain his proper end well then god constitutes every animal one to be eaten another to serve for agriculture another to supply cheese and another for some like use for which purposes what need is there to understand appearances and to be able to distinguish them but god has introduced man to be a spectator of god and of his works and not only a spectator of them but an interpreter for this reason it is shameful for man to begin and to end where irrational animals do but rather he ought to begin where they begin and to end where nature ends in us and nature ends in contemplation and underst
anding and in a way of life conformable to nature take care then not to die without having been spectators of these things  but you take a journey to olympia to see the work of phidias and all of you think it a misfortune to die without having seen such things but when there is no need to take a journey and where a man is there he has the works of god before him will you not desire to see and understand them will you not perceive either what you are or what you were born for or what this is for which you have received the faculty of sight but you may say there are some things disagreeable and troublesome in life and are there none at olympia are you not scorched are you not pressed by a crowd are you not without comfortable means of bathing are you not wet when it rains have you not abundance of noise clamour and other disagreeable things but i suppose that setting all these things off against the magnificence of the spectacle you bear and endure well then and have you not received faculties by which you will
 be able to bear all that happens have you not received greatness of soul have you not received manliness have you not received endurance and why do i trouble myself about anything that can happen if i possess greatness of soul what shall distract my mind or disturb me or appear painful shall i not use the power for the purposes for which i received it and shall i grieve and lament over what happens  yes but my nose runs for what purpose then slave have you hands is it not that you may wipe your nose is it then consistent with reason that there should be running of noses in the world nay how much better it is to wipe your nose than to find fault what do you think that hercules would have been if there had not been such a lion and hydra and stag and boar and certain unjust and bestial men whom hercules used to drive away and clear out and what would he have been doing if there had been nothing of the kind is it not plain that he would have wrapped himself up and have slept in the first place then he would not 
have been a hercules when he was dreaming away all his life in such luxury and ease and even if he had been one what would have been the use of him and what the use of his arms and of the strength of the other parts of his body and his endurance and noble spirit if such circumstances and occasions had not roused and exercised him well then must a man provide for himself such means of exercise and seek to introduce a lion from some place into his country and a boar and a hydra this would be folly and madness but as they did exist and were found they were useful for showing what hercules was and for exercising him come then do you also having observed these things look to the faculties which you have and when you have looked at them say bring now o zeus any difficulty that thou pleasest for i have means given to me by thee and powers for honoring myself through the things which happen you do not so but you sit still trembling for fear that some things will happen and weeping and lamenting and groaning for what 
does happen and then you blame the gods for what is the consequence of such meanness of spirit but impiety and yet god has not only given us these faculties by which we shall be able to bear everything thing happens without being depressed or broken by it but like a good king and a true father he has given us these faculties free from hindrance subject to no compulsion unimpeded and has put them entirely in our own power without even having reserved to himself any power of hindering or impeding you who have received these powers free and as your own use them not you do not even see what you have received and from whom some of you being blinded to the giver and not even acknowledging your benefactor and others through meanness of spirit betaking yourselves to faultfinding and making charges against god yet i will show to you that you have powers and means for greatness of soul and manliness but what powers you have for finding fault and making accusations do you show me  vii of the use of sophistical arguments
 and hypothetical and the like the handling of sophistical and hypothetical arguments and of those which derive their conclusions from questioning and in a word the handling of all such arguments relates to the duties of life though the many do not know this truth for in every matter we inquire how the wise and good man shall discover the proper path and the proper method of dealing with the matter let then people either say that the grave man will not descend into the contest of question and answer or that if he does descend into the contest he will take no care about not conducting himself rashly or carelessly in questioning and answering but if they do not allow either the one or the other of these things they must admit that some inquiry ought to be made into those topics τόπων on which particularly questioning and answering are employed for what is the end proposed in reasoning to establish true propositions to remove the false to withhold assent from those which are not plain is it enough then to have l
earned only this it is enough a man may reply is it then also enough for a man who would not make a mistake in the use of coined money to have heard this precept that he should receive the genuine drachmae and reject the spurious it is not enough what then ought to be added to this precept what else than the faculty which proves and distinguishes the genuine and the spurious drachmae consequently also in reasoning what has been said is not enough but it is necessary that a man should acquire the faculty of examining and distinguishing the true and the false and that which is not plain it is necessary besides this what is proposed in reasoning that you should accept what follows from that which you have properly granted well is it then enough in this case also to know this it is not enough but a man must learn how one thing is a consequence of other things and when one thing follows from one thing and when it follows from several collectively consider then if it be not necessary that this power should also be 
acquired by him who purposes to conduct himself skillfully in reasoning the power of demonstrating himself the several things which he has proposed and the power of understanding the demonstrations of others and of not being deceived by sophists as if they were demonstrating therefore there has arisen among us the practice and exercise of conclusive arguments and figures and it has been shown to be necessary  but in fact in some cases we have properly granted the premises or assumptions and there results from them something and though it is not true yet nonetheless it does result what then ought i to do ought i to admit the falsehood and how is that possible well should i say that i did not properly grant that which we agreed upon but you are not allowed to do even this shall i then say that the consequence does not arise through what has been conceded but neither is this allowed what then must be done in this case consider if it is not this as to have borrowed is not enough to make a man still a debtor but t
o this must be added the fact that he continues to owe the money and that the debt is not paid so it is not enough to compel you to admit the inference that you have granted the premises τὰ λήμματα but you must abide by what you have granted indeed if the premises continue to the end such as they were when they were granted it is absolutely necessary for us to abide by what we have granted and we must accept their consequences but if the premises do not remain such as they were when they were granted it is absolutely necessary for us also to withdraw from what we granted and from accepting what does not follow from the words in which our concessions were made for the inference is now not our inference nor does it result with our assent since we have withdrawn from the premises which we granted we ought then both to examine such kinds of premises and such change and variation of them from one meaning to another by which in the course of questioning or answering or in making the syllogistic conclusion or in any
 other such way the premises undergo variations and give occasion to the foolish to be confounded if they do not see what conclusions consequences are for what reason ought we to examine in order that we may not in this matter be employed in an improper manner nor in a confused way  and the same in hypotheses and hypothetical arguments for it is necessary sometimes to demand the granting of some hypothesis as a kind of passage to the argument which follows must we then allow every hypothesis that is proposed or not allow every one and if not every one which should we allow and if a man has allowed a hypothesis must he in every case abide by allowing it or must he sometimes withdraw from it but admit the consequences and not admit contradictions yes but suppose that a man says if you admit the hypothesis of a possibility i will draw you to an impossibility with such a person shall a man of sense refuse to enter into a contest and avoid discussion and conversation with him but what other man than the man of sen
se can use argumentation and is skillful in questioning and answering and incapable of being cheated and deceived by false reasoning and shall he enter into the contest and yet not take care whether he shall engage in argument not rashly and not carelessly and if he does not take care how can he be such a man as we conceive him to be but without some such exercise and preparation can he maintain a continuous and consistent argument let them show this and all these speculations θεωρήματα become superfluous and are absurd and inconsistent with our notion of a good and serious man  why are we still indolent and negligent and sluggish and why do we seek pretences for not laboring and not being watchful in cultivating our reason if then i shall make a mistake in these matters may i not have killed my father slave where was there a father in this matter that you could kill him what then have you done the only fault that was possible here is the fault which you have committed this is the very remark which i made to 
rufus when he blamed me for not having discovered the one thing omitted in a certain syllogism i suppose i said that i have burnt the capitol slave he replied was the thing omitted here the capitol or are these the only crimes to burn the capitol and to kill your father but for a man to use the appearances presented to him rashly and foolishly and carelessly and not to understand argument nor demonstration nor sophism nor in a word to see in questioning and answering what is consistent with that which we have granted or is not consistent is there no error in this  viii that the faculties are not safe to the uninstructed in as many ways as we can change things which are equivalent to one another in just so many ways we can change the forms of arguments ἐπιχειρήματα and enthymemes ἐνθυμήματα in argumentation this is an instance if you have borrowed and not repaid you owe me the money you have not borrowed and you have not repaid then you do not owe me the money to do this skillfully is suitable to no man more t
han to the philosopher for if the enthymeme is an imperfect syllogism it is plain that he who has been exercised in the perfect syllogism must be equally expert in the imperfect also  why then do we not exercise ourselves and one another in this manner because i reply at present though we are not exercised in these things and not distracted from the study of morality by me at least still we make no progress in virtue what then must we expect if we should add this occupation and particularly as this would not only be an occupation which would withdraw us from more necessary things but would also be a cause of selfconceit and arrogance and no small cause for great is the power of arguing and the faculty of persuasion and particularly if it should be much exercised and also receive additional ornament from language and so universally every faculty acquired by the uninstructed and weak brings with it the danger of these persons being elated and inflated by it for by what means could one persuade a young man who e
xcels in these matters that he ought not to become an appendage to them but to make them an appendage to himself does he not trample on all such reasons and strut before us elated and inflated not enduring that any man should reprove him and remind him of what he has neglected and to what he has turned aside  what then was not plato a philosopher i reply and was not hippocrates a physician but you see how hippocrates speaks does hippocrates then speak thus in respect of being a physician why do you mingle things which have been accidentally united in the same men and if plato was handsome and strong ought i also to set to work and endeavor to become handsome or strong as if this was necessary for philosophy because a certain philosopher was at the same time handsome and a philosopher will you not choose to see and to distinguish in respect to what men become philosophers and what things belong to them in other respects and if i were a philosopher ought you also to be made lame what then do i take away these f
aculties which you possess by no means for neither do i take away the faculty of seeing but if you ask me what is the good of man i cannot mention to you anything else than that it is a certain disposition of the will with respect to appearances  ix how from the fact that we are akin to god a man may proceed to the consequences if the things are true which are said by the philosophers about the kinship between god and man what else remains for men to do than what socrates did never in reply to the question to what country you belong say that you are an athenian or a corinthian but that you are a citizen of the world κόσμιος for why do you say that you are an athenian and why do you not say that you belong to the small nook only into which your poor body was cast at birth is it not plain that you call yourself an athenian or corinthian from the place which has a greater authority and comprises not only that small nook itself and all your family but even the whole country from which the stock of your progenitor
s is derived down to you he then who has observed with intelligence the administration of the world and has learned that the greatest and supreme and the most comprehensive community is that which is composed of men and god and that from god have descended the seeds not only to my father and grandfather but to all beings which are generated on the earth and are produced and particularly to rational beingsfor these only are by their nature formed to have communion with god being by means of reason conjoined with himwhy should not such a man call himself a citizen of the world why not a son of god and why should he be afraid of anything which happens among men is kinship with caesar the emperor or with any other of the powerful in rome sufficient to enable us to live in safety and above contempt and without any fear at all and to have god for your maker ποιητήν and father and guardian shall not this release us from sorrows and fears  but a man may say whence shall i get bread to eat when i have nothing  and how
 do slaves and runawayson what do they rely when they leave their masters do they rely on their lands or slaves or their vessels of silver they rely on nothing but themselves and food does not fail them and shall it be necessary for one among us who is a philosopher to travel into foreign parts and trust to and rely on others and not to take care of himself and shall he be inferior to irrational animals and more cowardly each of which being selfsufficient neither fails to get its proper food nor to find a suitable way of living and one conformable to nature  i indeed think that the old man ought to be sitting here not to contrive how you may have no mean thoughts nor mean and ignoble talk about yourselves but to take care that there be not among us any young men of such a mind that when they have recognised their kinship to god and that we are fettered by these bondsthe body i mean and its possessions and whatever else on account of them is necessary to us for the economy and commerce of lifethey should inten
d to throw off these things as if they were burdens painful and intolerable and to depart to their kinsmen but this is the labor that your teacher and instructor ought to be employed upon if he really were what he should be you should come to him and say epictetus we can no longer endure being bound to this poor body and feeding it and giving it drink and rest and cleaning it and for the sake of the body complying with the wishes of these and of those are not these things indifferent and nothing to us and is not death no evil and are we not in a manner kinsmen of god and did we not come from him allow us to depart to the place from which we came allow us to be released at last from these bonds by which we are bound and weighed down here there are robbers and thieves and courts of justice and those who are named tyrants and think that they have some power over us by means of the body and its possessions permit us to show them that they have no power over any man and i on my part would say friends wait for god 
when he shall give the signal and release you from this service then go to him but for the present endure to dwell in this place where he has put you short indeed is this time of your dwelling here and easy to bear for those who are so disposed for what tyrant or what thief or what courts of justice are formidable to those who have thus considered as things of no value the body and the possessions of the body wait then do not depart without a reason  something like this ought to be said by the teacher to ingenuous youths but now what happens the teacher is a lifeless body and you are lifeless bodies when you have been well filled today you sit down and lament about the morrow how you shall get something to eat wretch if you have it you will have it if you have it not you will depart from life the door is open why do you grieve where does there remain any room for tears and where is there occasion for flattery why shall one man envy another why should a man admire the rich or the powerful even if they be both 
very strong and of violent temper for what will they do to us we shall not care for that which they can do and what we do care for that they cannot do how did socrates behave with respect to these matters why in what other way than a man ought to do who was convinced that he was a kinsman of the gods if you say to me now said socrates to his judges we will acquit you on the condition that you no longer discourse in the way in which you have hitherto discoursed nor trouble either our young or our old men i shall answer you make yourselves ridiculous by thinking that if one of our commanders has appointed me to a certain post it is my duty to keep and maintain it and to resolve to die a thousand times rather than desert it but if god has put us in any place and way of life we ought to desert it socrates speaks like a man who is really a kinsman of the gods but we think about ourselves as if we were only stomachs and intestines and shameful parts we fear we desire we flatter those who are able to help us in thes
e matters and we fear them also  a man asked me to write to rome about him a man who as most people thought had been unfortunate for formerly he was a man of rank and rich but had been stripped of all and was living here i wrote on his behalf in a submissive manner but when he had read the letter he gave it back to me and said i wished for your help not your pity no evil has happened to me  thus also musonius rufus in order to try me used to say this and this will befall you from your master and when i replied that these were things which happen in the ordinary course of human affairs why then said he should i ask him for anything when i can obtain it from you for in fact what a man has from himself it is superfluous and foolish to receive from another shall i then who am able to receive from myself greatness of soul and a generous spirit receive from you land and money or a magisterial office i hope not i will not be so ignorant about my own possessions but when a man is cowardly and mean what else must be d
one for him than to write letters as you would about a corpse please to grant us the body of a certain person and a sextarius of poor blood for such a person is in fact a carcass and a sextarius a certain quantity of blood and nothing more but if he were anything more he would know that one man is not miserable through the means of another  x against those who eagerly seek preferment at rome if we applied ourselves as busily to our own work as the old men at rome do to those matters about which they are employed perhaps we also might accomplish something i am acquainted with a man older than myself who is now superintendent of corn at rome and i remember the time when he came here on his way back from exile and what he said as he related the events of his former life and how he declared that with respect to the future after his return he would look after nothing else than passing the rest of his life in quiet and tranquillity for how little of life he said remains for me i replied you will not do it but as so
on as you smell rome you will forget all that you have said and if admission is allowed even into the imperial palace he will gladly thrust himself in and thank god if you find me epictetus he answered setting even one foot within the palace think what you please well what then did he do before he entered the city he was met by letters from caesar and as soon as he received them he forgot all and ever after has added one piece of business to another i wish that i were now by his side to remind him of what he said when he was passing this way and to tell him how much better a seer i am than he is  well then do i say that man is an animal made for doing nothing certainly not but why are we not active we are active for example as to myself as soon as day comes in a few words i remind myself of what i must read over to my pupils then forthwith i say to myself but what is it to me how a certain person shall read the first thing for me is to sleep and indeed what resemblance is there between what other persons do a
nd what we do if you observe what they do you will understand and what else do they do all day long than make up accounts enquire among themselves give and take advice about some small quantity of grain a bit of land and such kind of profits is it then the same thing to receive a petition and to read in it i entreat you to permit me to export a small quantity of corn and one to this effect i entreat you to learn from chrysippus what is the administration of the world and what place in it the rational animal holds consider also who you are and what is the nature of your good and bad are these things like the other do they require equal care and is it equally base to neglect these and those well then are we the only persons who are lazy and love sleep no but much rather you young men are for we old men when we see young men amusing themselves are eager to play with them and if i saw you active and zealous much more should i be eager myself to join you in your serious pursuits  xi of natural affection when he wa
s visited by one of the magistrates epictetus inquired of him about several particulars and asked if he had children and a wife the man replied that he had and epictetus inquired further how he felt under the circumstances miserable the man said then epictetus asked in what respect for men do not marry and beget children in order to be wretched but rather to be happy but i the man replied am so wretched about my children that lately when my little daughter was sick and was supposed to be in danger i could not endure to stay with her but i left home till a person sent me news that she had recovered well then said epictetus do you think that you acted right i acted naturally the man replied but convince me of this that you acted naturally and i will convince you that everything which takes place according to nature takes place rightly this is the case said the man with all or at least most fathers i do not deny that but the matter about which we are inquiring is whether such behavior is right for in respect to 
this matter we must say that tumours also come for the good of the body because they do come and generally we must say that to do wrong is natural because nearly all or at least most of us do wrong do you show me then how your behavior is natural i cannot he said but do you rather show me how it is not according to nature and is not rightly done  well said epictetus if we were inquiring about white and black what criterion should we employ for distinguishing between them the sight he said and if about hot and cold and hard and soft what criterion the touch well then since we are inquiring about things which are according to nature and those which are done rightly or not rightly what kind of criterion do you think that we should employ i do not know he said and yet not to know the criterion of colors and smells and also of tastes is perhaps no great harm but if a man do not know the criterion of good and bad and of things according to nature and contrary to nature does this seem to you a small harm the greates
t harm i think come tell me do all things which seem to some persons to be good and becoming rightly appear such and at present as to jews and syrians and egyptians and romans is it possible that the opinions of all of them in respect to food are right how is it possible he said well i suppose it is absolutely necessary that if the opinions of the egyptians are right the opinions of the rest must be wrong if the opinions of the jews are right those of the rest cannot be right certainly but where there is ignorance there also there is want of learning and training in things which are necessary he assented to this you then said epictetus since you know this for the future will employ yourself seriously about nothing else and will apply your mind to nothing else than to learn the criterion of things which are according to nature and by using it also to determine each several thing but in the present matter i have so much as this to aid you towards what you wish does affection to those of your family appear to yo
u to be according to nature and to be good certainly well is such affection natural and good and is a thing consistent with reason not good by no means is then that which is consistent with reason in contradiction with affection i think not you are right for if it is otherwise it is necessary that one of the contradictions being according to nature the other must be contrary to nature is it not so it is he said whatever then we shall discover to be at the same time affectionate and also consistent with reason this we confidently declare to be right and good agreed well then to leave your sick child and to go away is not reasonable and i suppose that you will not say that it is but it remains for us to inquire if it is consistent with affection yes let us consider did you then since you had an affectionate disposition to your child do right when you ran off and left her and has the mother no affection for the child certainly she has ought then the mother also to have left her or ought she not she ought not and
 the nurse does she love her she does ought then she also to have left her by no means and the pedagogue does he not love her he does love her ought then he also to have deserted her and so should the child have been left alone and without help on account of the great affection of you the parents and of those about her or should she have died in the hands of those who neither loved her nor cared for her certainly not now this is unfair and unreasonable not to allow those who have equal affection with yourself to do what you think to be proper for yourself to do because you have affection it is absurd come then if you were sick would you wish your relations to be so affectionate and all the rest children and wife as to leave you alone and deserted by no means and would you wish to be so loved by your own that through their excessive affection you would always be left alone in sickness or for this reason would you rather pray if it were possible to be loved by your enemies and deserted by them but if this is so
 it results that your behavior was not at all an affectionate act  well then was it nothing which moved you and induced you to desert your child and how is that possible but it might be something of the kind which moved a man at rome to wrap up his head while a horse was running which he favored and when contrary to expectation the horse won he required sponges to recover from his fainting fit what then is the thing which moved the exact discussion of this does not belong to the present occasion perhaps but it is enough to be convinced of this if what the philosophers say is true that we must not look for it anywhere without but in all cases it is one and the same thing which is the cause of our doing or not doing something of saying or not saying something of being elated or depressed of avoiding anything or pursuing the very thing which is now the cause to me and to you to you of coming to me and sitting and hearing and to me of saying what i do say and what is this is it any other than our will to do so no
 other but if we had willed otherwise what else should we have been doing than that which we willed to do this then was the cause of achilles lamentation not the death of patroclus for another man does not behave thus on the death of his companion but it was because he chose to do so and to you this was the very cause of your then running away that you chose to do so and on the other side if you should hereafter stay with her the reason will be the same and now you are going to rome because you choose and if you should change your mind you will not go thither and in a word neither death nor exile nor pain nor anything of the kind is the cause of our doing anything or not doing but our own opinions and our wills δόγματα  do i convince you of this or not you do convince me such then as the causes are in each case such also are the effects when then we are doing anything not rightly from this day we shall impute it to nothing else than to the will δόγμα or opinion from which we have done it and it is that which 
we shall endeavor to take away and to extirpate more than the tumours and abscesses out of the body and in like manner we shall give the same account of the cause of the things which we do right and we shall no longer allege as causes of any evil to us either slave or neighbour or wife or children being persuaded that if we do not think things to be what we do think them to be we do not the acts which follow from such opinions and as to thinking or not thinking that is in our power and not in externals it is so he said from this day then we shall inquire into and examine nothing else what its quality is or its state neither land nor slaves nor horses nor dogs nothing else than opinions i hope so you see then that you must become a scholasticus an animal whom all ridicule if you really intend to make an examination of your own opinions and that this is not the work of one hour or day you know yourself  xii of contentment with respect to gods there are some who say that a divine being does not exist others say 
that it exists but is inactive and careless and takes no forethought about anything a third class say that such a being exists and exercises forethought but only about great things and heavenly things and about nothing on the earth a fourth class say that a divine being exercises forethought both about things on the earth and heavenly things but in a general way only and not about things severally there is a fifth class to whom ulysses and socrates belong who say i move not without thy knowledge iliad x   before all other things then it is necessary to inquire about each of these opinions whether it is affirmed truly or not truly for if there are no gods how is it our proper end to follow them and if they exist but take no care of anything in this case also how will it be right to follow them but if indeed they do exist and look after things still if there is nothing communicated from them to men nor in fact to myself how even so is it right to follow them the wise and good man then after considering all thes
e things submits his own mind to him who administers the whole as good citizens do to the law of the state he who is receiving instruction ought to come to be instructed with this intention how shall i follow the gods in all things how shall i be contented with the divine administration and how can i become free for he is free to whom everything happens according to his will and whom no man can hinder what then is freedom madness certainly not for madness and freedom do not consist but you say i would have everything result just as i like and in whatever way i like you are mad you are beside yourself do you not know that freedom is a noble and valuable thing but for me inconsiderately to wish for things to happen as i inconsiderately like this appears to be not only not noble but even most base for how do we proceed in the matter of writing do i wish to write the name of dion as i choose no but i am taught to choose to write it as it ought to be written and how with respect to music in the same manner and wha
t universally in every art or science just the same if it were not so it would be of no value to know anything if knowledge were adapted to every mans whim is it then in this alone in this which is the greatest and the chief thing i mean freedom that i am permitted to will inconsiderately by no means but to be instructed is this to learn to wish that everything may happen as it does and how do things happen as the disposer has disposed them and he has appointed summer and winter and abundance and scarcity and virtue and vice and all such opposites for the harmony of the whole and to each of us he has given a body and parts of the body and possessions and companions  remembering then this disposition of things we ought to go to be instructed not that we may change the constitution of thingsfor we have not the power to do it nor is it better that we should have the powerbut in order that as the things around us are what they are and by nature exist we may maintain our minds in harmony with the things which happ
en for can we escape from men and how is it possible and if we associate with them can we change them who gives us the power what then remains or what method is discovered of holding commerce with them is there such a method by which they shall do what seems fit to them and we not the less shall be in a mood which is conformable to nature but you are unwilling to endure and are discontented and if you are alone you call it solitude and if you are with men you call them knaves and robbers and you find fault with your own parents and children and brothers and neighbours but you ought when you are alone to call this condition by the name of tranquillity and freedom and to think yourself like to the gods and when you are with many you ought not to call it crowd nor trouble nor uneasiness but festival and assembly and so accept all contentedly  what then is the punishment of those who do not accept it is to be what they are is any person dissatisfied with being alone let him be alone is a man dissatisfied with his
 parents let him be a bad son and lament is he dissatisfied with his children let him be a bad father cast him into prison what prison where he is already for he is there against his will and where a man is against his will there he is in prison so socrates was not in prison for he was there willingly must my leg then be lamed wretch do you then on account of one poor leg find fault with the world will you not willingly surrender it for the whole will you not withdraw from it will you not gladly part with it to him who gave it and will you be vexed and discontented with the things established by zeus which he with the moirae fates who were present and spinning the thread of your generation defined and put in order know you not how small a part you are compared with the whole i mean with respect to the body for as to intelligence you are not inferior to the gods nor less for the magnitude of intelligence is not measured by length nor yet by height but by thoughts  will you not then choose to place your good in
 that in which you are equal to the gods wretch that i am to have such a father and mother what then was it permitted to you to come forth and to select and to say let such a man at this moment unite with such a woman that i may be produced it was not permitted but it was a necessity for your parents to exist first and then for you to be begotten of what kind of parents of such as they were well then since they are such as they are is there no remedy given to you now if you did not know for what purpose you possess the faculty of vision you would be unfortunate and wretched if you closed your eyes when colors were brought before them but in that you possess greatness of soul and nobility of spirit for every event that may happen and you know not that you possess them are you not more unfortunate and wretched things are brought close to you which are proportionate to the power which you possess but you turn away this power most particularly at the very time when you ought to maintain it open and discerning do 
you not rather thank the gods that they have allowed you to be above these things which they have not placed in your power and have made you accountable only for those which are in your power as to your parents the gods have left you free from responsibility and so with respect to your brothers and your body and possessions and death and life for what then have they made you responsible for that which alone is in your power the proper use of appearances why then do you draw on yourself the things for which you are not responsible it is indeed a giving of trouble to yourself  xiii how everything may be done acceptably to the gods when someone asked how may a man eat acceptably to the gods he answered if he can eat justly and contentedly and with equanimity and temperately and orderly will it not be also acceptably to the gods but when you have asked for warm water and the slave has not heard or if he did hear has brought only tepid water or he is not even found to be in the house then not to be vexed or to bur
st with passion is not this acceptable to the godshow then shall a man endure such persons as this slave slave yourself will you not bear with your own brother who has zeus for his progenitor and is like a son from the same seeds and of the same descent from above but if you have been put in any such higher place will you immediately make yourself a tyrant will you not remember who you are and whom you rule that they are kinsmen that they are brethren by nature that they are the offspring of zeusbut i have purchased them and they have not purchased me do you see in what direction you are looking that it is towards the earth towards the pit that it is towards these wretched laws of dead men but towards the laws of the gods you are not looking  xiv that the deity oversees all things when a person asked him how a man could be convinced that all his actions are under the inspection of god he answered do you not think that all things are united in one i do the person replied well do you not think that earthly thin
gs have a natural agreement and union with heavenly things i do and how else so regularly as if by gods command when he bids the plants to flower do they flower when he bids them to send forth shoots do they shoot when he bids them to produce fruit how else do they produce fruit when he bids the fruit to ripen does it ripen when again he bids them to cast down the fruits how else do they cast them down and when to shed the leaves do they shed the leaves and when he bids them to fold themselves up and to remain quiet and rest how else do they remain quiet and rest and how else at the growth and the wane of the moon and at the approach and recession of the sun are so great an alteration and change to the contrary seen in earthly things but are plants and our bodies so bound up and united with the whole and are not our souls much more and our souls so bound up and in contact with god as parts of him and portions of him and does not god perceive every motion of these parts as being his own motion connate with him
self now are you able to think of the divine administration and about all things divine and at the same time also about human affairs and to be moved by ten thousand things at the same time in your senses and in your understanding and to assent to some and to dissent from others and again as to some things to suspend your judgment and do you retain in your soul so many impressions from so many and various things and being moved by them do you fall upon notions similar to those first impressed and do you retain numerous arts and the memories of ten thousand things and is not god able to oversee all things and to be present with all and to receive from all a certain communication and is the sun able to illuminate so large a part of the all and to leave so little not illuminated that part only which is occupied by the earths shadow and he who made the sun itself and makes it go round being a small part of himself compared with the whole cannot he perceive all things  but i cannot the man may reply comprehend all
 these things at once but who tells you that you have equal power with zeus nevertheless he has placed by every man a guardian every mans daemon to whom he has committed the care of the man a guardian who never sleeps is never deceived for to what better and more careful guardian could he have entrusted each of us when then you have shut the doors and made darkness within remember never to say that you are alone for you are not but god is within and your daemon is within and what need have they of light to see what you are doing to this god you ought to swear an oath just as the soldiers do to caesar but they who are hired for pay swear to regard the safety of caesar before all things and you who have received so many and such great favors will you not swear or when you have sworn will you not abide by your oath and what shall you swear never to be disobedient never to make any charges never to find fault with anything that he has given and never unwillingly to do or to suffer anything that is necessary is th
is oath like the soldiers oath the soldiers swear not to prefer any man to caesar in this oath men swear to honor themselves before all  xv what philosophy promises when a man was consulting him how he should persuade his brother to cease being angry with him epictetus replied philosophy does not propose to secure for a man any external thing if it did or if it were not as i say philosophy would be allowing something which is not within its province for as the carpenters material is wood and that of the statuary is copper so the matter of the art of living is each mans life what then is my brothers that again belongs to his own art but with respect to yours it is one of the external things like a piece of land like health like reputation but philosophy promises none of these in every circumstance i will maintain she says the governing part conformable to nature whose governing part his in whom i am she says  how then shall my brother cease to be angry with me bring him to me and i will tell him but i have not
hing to say to you about his anger  when the man who was consulting him said i seek to know this how even if my brother is not reconciled to me shall i maintain myself in a state conformable to nature nothing great said epictetus is produced suddenly since not even the grape or the fig is if you say to me now that you want a fig i will answer to you that it requires time let it flower first then put forth fruit and then ripen is then the fruit of a figtree not perfected suddenly and in one hour and would you possess the fruit of a mans mind in so short a time and so easily do not expect it even if i tell you  xvi of providence do not wonder if for other animals than man all things are provided for the body not only food and drink but beds also and they have no need of shoes nor bed materials nor clothing but we require all these additional things for animals not being made for themselves but for service it was not fit for them to be made so as to need other things for consider what it would be for us to take 
care not only of ourselves but also about cattle and asses how they should be clothed and how shod and how they should eat and drink now as soldiers are ready for their commander shod clothed and armed but it would be a hard thing for the chiliarch tribune to go round and shoe or clothe his thousand men so also nature has formed the animals which are made for service all ready prepared and requiring no further care so one little boy with only a stick drives the cattle  but now we instead of being thankful that we need not take the same care of animals as of ourselves complain of god on our own account and yet in the name of zeus and the gods any one thing of those which exist would be enough to make a man perceive the providence of god at least a man who is modest and grateful and speak not to me now of the great things but only of this that milk is produced from grass and cheese from milk and wool from skins who made these things or devised them no one you say o amazing shamelessness and stupidity  well let 
us omit the works of nature and contemplate her smaller subordinate πάρεργα acts is there anything less useful than the hair on the chin what then has not nature used this hair also in the most suitable manner possible has she not by it distinguished the male and the female does not the nature of every man forthwith proclaim from a distance i am a man as such approach me as such speak to me look for nothing else see the signs again in the case of women as she has mingled something softer in the voice so she has also deprived them of hair on the chin you say not so the human animal ought to have been left without marks of distinction and each of us should have been obliged to proclaim i am a man but how is not the sign beautiful and becoming and venerable how much more beautiful than the cocks comb how much more becoming than the lions mane for this reason we ought to preserve the signs which god has given we ought not to throw them away nor to confound as much as we can the distinctions of the sexes  are thes
e the only works of providence in us and what words are sufficient to praise them and set them forth according to their worth for if we had understanding ought we to do anything else both jointly and severally than to sing hymns and bless the deity and to tell of his benefits ought we not when we are digging and ploughing and eating to sing this hymn to god great is god who has given us such implements with which we shall cultivate the earth great is god who has given us hands the power of swallowing a stomach imperceptible growth and the power of breathing while we sleep this is what we ought to sing on every occasion and to sing the greatest and most divine hymn for giving us the faculty of comprehending these things and using a proper way well then since most of you have become blind ought there not to be some man to fill this office and on behalf of all to sing the hymn to god for what else can i do a lame old man than sing hymns to god if then i was a nightingale i would do the part of a nightingale if i
 were a swan i would do like a swan but now i am a rational creature and i ought to praise god this is my work i do it nor will i desert this post so long as i am allowed to keep it and i exhort you to join in this same song  xvii that the logical art is necessary since reason is the faculty which analyses and perfects the rest and it ought itself not to be unanalysed by what should it be analysed for it is plain that this should be done either by itself or by another thing either then this other thing also is reason or something else superior to reason which is impossible but if it is reason again who shall analyse that reason for if that reason does this for itself our reason also can do it but if we shall require something else the thing will go on to infinity and have no end reason therefore is analysed by itself yes but it is more urgent to cure our opinions and the like will you then hear about those things hear but if you should say i know not whether you are arguing truly or falsely and if i should ex
press myself in any way ambiguously and you should say to me distinguish i will bear with you no longer and i shall say to you it is more urgent this is the reason i suppose why they the stoic teachers place the logical art first as in the measuring of corn we place first the examination of the measure but if we do not determine first what is a modius and what is a balance how shall we be able to measure or weigh anything  in this case then if we have not fully learned and accurately examined the criterion of all other things by which the other things are learned shall we be able to examine accurately and to learn fully anything else how is this possible yes but the modius is only wood and a thing which produces no fruitbut it is a thing which can measure cornlogic also produces no fruitas to this indeed we shall see but then even if a man should grant this it is enough that logic has the power of distinguishing and examining other things and as we may say of measuring and weighing them who says this is it on
ly chrysippus and zeno and cleanthes and does not antisthenes say so and who is it that has written that the examination of names is the beginning of education and does not socrates say so and of whom does xenophon write that he began with the examination of names what each name signified is this then the great and wondrous thing to understand or interpret chrysippus who says thiswhat then is the wondrous thingto understand the will of nature well then do you apprehend it yourself by your own power and what more have you need of for if it is true that all men err involuntarily and you have learned the truth of necessity you must act rightbut in truth i do not apprehend the will of nature who then tells us what it isthey say that it is chrysippusi proceed and i inquire what this interpreter of nature says i begin not to understand what he says i seek an interpreter of chrysippuswell consider how this is said just as if it were said in the roman tonguewhat then is this superciliousness of the interpreter there 
is no superciliousness which can justly be charged even to chrysippus if he only interprets the will of nature but does not follow it himself and much more is this so with his interpreter for we have no need of chrysippus for his own sake but in order that we may understand nature nor do we need a diviner sacrificer on his own account but because we think that through him we shall know the future and understand the signs given by the gods nor do we need the viscera of animals for their own sake but because through them signs are given nor do we look with wonder on the crow or raven but on god who through them gives signs  i go then to the interpreter of these things and the sacrificer and i say inspect the viscera for me and tell me what signs they give the man takes the viscera opens them and interprets man he says you have a will free by nature from hindrance and compulsion this is written here in the viscera i will show you this first in the matter of assent can any man hinder you from assenting to the tru
th no man can can any man compel you to receive what is false no man can you see that in this matter you have the faculty of the will free from hindrance free from compulsion unimpeded well then in the matter of desire and pursuit of an object is it otherwise and what can overcome pursuit except another pursuit and what can overcome desire and aversion ἔκκλισιν except another desire and aversion but you object if you place before me the fear of death you do compel me no it is not what is placed before you that compels but your opinion that it is better to do soandso than to die in this matter then it is your opinion that compelled you that is will compelled will for if god had made that part of himself which he took from himself and gave to us of such a nature as to be hindered or compelled either by himself or by another he would not then be god nor would he be taking care of us as he ought this says the diviner i find in the victims these are the things which are signified to you if you choose you are free 
if you choose you will blame no one you will charge no one all will be at the same time according to your mind and the mind of god for the sake of this divination i go to this diviner and to the philosopher not admiring him for this interpretation but admiring the things which he interprets  xviii that we ought not to be angry with the errors faults of others if what philosophers say is true that all men have one principle as in the case of assent the persuasion that a thing is so and in the case of dissent the persuasion that a thing is not so and in the case of a suspense of judgment the persuasion that a thing is uncertain so also in the case of a movement towards any thing the persuasion that a thing is for a mans advantage and it is impossible to think that one thing is advantageous and to desire another and to judge one thing to be proper and to move towards another why then are we angry with the many they are thieves and robbers you may say what do you mean by thieves and robbers they are mistaken abou
t good and evil ought we then to be angry with them or to pity them but show them their error and you will see how they desist from their errors if they do not see their errors they have nothing superior to their present opinion  ought not then this robber and this adulterer to be destroyed by no means say so but speak rather in this way this man who has been mistaken and deceived about the most important things and blinded not in the faculty of vision which distinguishes white and black but in the faculty which distinguishes good and bad should we not destroy him if you speak thus you will see how inhuman this is which you say and that it is just as if you would say ought we not to destroy this blind and deaf man but if the greatest harm is the privation of the greatest things and the greatest thing in every man is the will or choice such as it ought to be and a man is deprived of this will why are you also angry with him man you ought not to be affected contrary to nature by the bad things of another pity h
im rather drop this readiness to be offended and to hate and these words which the many utter these accursed and odious fellows how have you been made so wise at once and how are you so peevish why then are we angry is it because we value so much the things of which these men rob us do not admire your clothes and then you will not be angry with the thief do not admire the beauty of your wife and you will not be angry with the adulterer learn that a thief and an adulterer have no place in the things which are yours but in those which belong to others and which are not in your power if you dismiss these things and consider them as nothing with whom are you still angry but so long as you value these things be angry with yourself rather than with the thief and the adulterer consider the matter thus you have fine clothes your neighbour has not you have a window you wish to air the clothes the thief does not know wherein mans good consists but he thinks that it consists in having fine clothes the very thing which y
ou also think must he not then come and take them away when you show a cake to greedy persons and swallow it all yourself do you expect them not to snatch it from you do not provoke them do not have a window do not air your clothes i also lately had an iron lamp placed by the side of my household gods hearing a noise at the door i ran down and found that the lamp had been carried off i reflected that he who had taken the lamp had done nothing strange what then tomorrow i said you will find an earthen lamp for a man only loses that which he has i have lost my garment the reason is that you had a garment i have pain in my head have you any pain in your horns why then are you troubled for we only lose those things we have only pains about those things which we possess  but the tyrant will chainwhat the leg he will take awaywhat the neck what then will he not chain and not take away the will this is why the ancients taught the maxim know thyself therefore we ought to exercise ourselves in small things and beginni
ng with them to proceed to the greater i have pain in the head do not say alas i have pain in the ear do not say alas and i do not say that you are not allowed to groan but do not groan inwardly and if your slave is slow in bringing a bandage do not cry out and torment yourself and say everybody hates me for who would not hate such a man for the future relying on these opinions walk about upright free not trusting to the size of your body as an athlete for a man ought not to be invincible in the way that an ass is  who then is the invincible it is he whom none of the things disturb which are independent of the will then examining one circumstance after another i observe as in the case of an athlete he has come off victorious in the first contest well then as to the second and what if there should be great heat and what if it should be at olympia and the same i say in this case if you should throw money in his way he will despise it well suppose you put a young girl in his way what then and what if it is in th
e dark what if it should be a little reputation or abuse and what if it should be praise and what if it should be death he is able to overcome all what then if it be in heat and what if it is in the rain and what if he be in a melancholy mad mood and what if he be asleep he will still conquer this is my invincible athlete  xix how we should behave to tyrants if a man possesses any superiority or thinks that he does when he does not such a man if he is uninstructed will of necessity be puffed up through it for instance the tyrant says i am master of all and what can you do for me can you give me desire which shall have no hindrance how can you have you the infallible power of avoiding what you would avoid have you the power of moving towards an object without error and how do you possess this power come when you are in a ship do you trust to yourself or to the helmsman and when you are in a chariot to whom do you trust but to the driver and how is it in all other arts just the same in what then lies your power
 all men pay respect to me well i also pay respect to my platter and i wash it and wipe it and for the sake of my oil flask i drive a peg into the wall well then are these things superior to me no but they supply some of my wants and for this reason i take care of them well do i not attend to my ass do i not wash his feet do i not clean him do you not know that every man has regard to himself and to you just the same as he has regard to his ass for who has regard to you as a man show me who wishes to become like you who imitates you as he imitates socrates but i can cut off your head you say right i had forgotten that i must have regard to you as i would to a fever and the bile and raise an altar to you as there is at rome an altar to fever  what is it then that disturbs and terrifies the multitude is it the tyrant and his guards by no means i hope that it is not so it is not possible that what is by nature free can be disturbed by anything else or hindered by any other thing than by itself but it is a mans o
wn opinions which disturb him for when the tyrant says to a man i will chain your leg he who values his leg says do not have pity but he who values his own will says if it appears more advantageous to you chain it do you not care i do not care i will show you that i am master you cannot do that zeus has set me free do you think that he intended to allow his own son to be enslaved but you are master of my carcass take it so when you approach me you have no regard to me no but i have regard to myself and if you wish me to say that i have regard to you also i tell you that i have the same regard to you that i have to my pipkin  this is not a perverse selfregard for the animal is constituted so as to do all things for itself for even the sun does all things for itself nay even zeus himself but when he chooses to be the giver of rain and the giver of fruits and the father of gods and men you see that he cannot obtain these functions and these names if he is not useful to man and universally he has made the nature 
of the rational animal such that it cannot obtain any one of its own proper interests if it does not contribute something to the common interest in this manner and sense it is not unsociable for a man to do everything for the sake of himself for what do you expect that a man should neglect himself and his own interest and how in that case can there be one and the same principle in all animals the principle of attachment regard to themselves  what then when absurd notions about things independent of our will as if they were good and or bad lie at the bottom of our opinions we must of necessity pay regard to tyrants for i wish that men would pay regard to tyrants only and not also to the bedchamber men how is it that the man becomes all at once wise when caesar has made him superintendent of the close stool how is it that we say immediately felicion spoke sensibly to me i wish he were ejected from the bedchamber that he might again appear to you to be a fool  epaphroditus had a shoemaker whom he sold because he
 was good for nothing this fellow by some good luck was bought by one of caesars men and became caesars shoemaker you should have seen what respect epaphroditus paid to him how does the good felicion do i pray then if any of us asked what is master epaphroditus doing the answer was he is consulting about something with felicion had he not sold the man as good for nothing who then made him wise all at once this is an instance of valuing something else than the things which depend on the will  has a man been exalted to the tribuneship all who meet him offer their congratulations one kisses his eyes another the neck and the slaves kiss his hands he goes to his house he finds torches lighted he ascends the capitol he offers a sacrifice on the occasion now who ever sacrificed for having had good desires for having acted conformably to nature for in fact we thank the gods for those things in which we place our good a person was talking to me today about the priesthood of augustus i say to him man let the thing alon
e you will spend much for no purpose but he replies those who draw up agreements will write my name do you then stand by those who read them and say to such persons it is i whose name is written there and if you can now be present on all such occasions what will you do when you are dead my name will remain write it on a stone and it will remain but come what remembrance of you will there be beyond nicopolis but i shall wear a crown of gold if you desire a crown at all take a crown of roses and put it on for it will be more elegant in appearance  xx about reason how it contemplates itself every art and faculty contemplates certain things especially when then it is itself of the same kind with the objects which it contemplates it must of necessity contemplate itself also but when it is of an unlike kind it cannot contemplate itself for instance the shoemakers art is employed on skins but itself is entirely distinct from the material of skins for this reason it does not contemplate itself again the grammarians a
rt is employed about articulate speech is then the art also articulate speech by no means for this reason it is not able to contemplate itself now reason for what purpose has it been given by nature for the right use of appearances what is it then itself a system combination of certain appearances so by its nature it has the faculty of contemplating itself also again sound sensefor the contemplation of what things does it belong to us good and evil and things which are neither what is it then itself good and want of sense what is it evil do you see then that good sense necessarily contemplates both itself and the opposite for this reason it is the chief and the first work of a philosopher to examine appearances and to distinguish them and to admit none without examination you see even in the matter of coin in which our interest appears to be somewhat concerned how we have invented an art and how many means the assayer uses to try the value of coin the sight the touch the smell and lastly the hearing he throws
 the coin denarius down and observes the sound and he is not content with its sounding once but through his great attention he becomes a musician in like manner where we think that to be mistaken and not to be mistaken make a great difference there we apply great attention to discovering the things which can deceive but in the matter of our miserable ruling faculty yawning and sleeping we carelessly admit every appearance for the harm is not noticed  when then you would know how careless you are with respect to good and evil and how active with respect to things which are indifferent neither good nor evil observe how you feel with respect to being deprived of the sight of the eyes and how with respect to being deceived and you will discover that you are far from feeling as you ought to do in relation to good and evil but this is a matter which requires much preparation and much labor and study well then do you expect to acquire the greatest of arts with small labor and yet the chief doctrine of philosophers i
s very brief if you would know read zenos writings and you will see for how few words it requires to say that mans end or object is to follow the gods and that the nature of good is a proper use of appearances but if you say what is god what is appearance and what is particular and what is universal nature then indeed many words are necessary if then epicurus should come and say that the good must be in the body in this case also many words become necessary and we must be taught what is the leading principle in us and the fundamental and the substantial and as it is not probable that the good of a snail is in the shell is it probable that the good of a man is in the body but you yourself epicurus possess something better than this what is that in you which deliberates what is that which examines everything what is that which forms a judgment about the body itself that it is the principal part and why do you light your lamp and labor for us and write so many books is it that we may not be ignorant of the truth
 who we are and what we are with respect to you thus the discussion requires many words  xxi against those who wish to be admired when a man holds his proper station in life he does not gape after things beyond it man what do you wish to happen to you i am satisfied if i desire and avoid conformably to nature if i employ movements towards and from an object as i am by nature formed to do and purpose and design and assent why then do you strut before us as if you had swallowed a spit my wish has always been that those who meet me should admire me and those who follow me should exclaim o the great philosopher  who are they by whom you wish to be admired are they not those of whom you are used to say that they are mad well then do you wish to be admired by madmen  xxii on precognitions precognitions are common to all men and precognition is not contradictory to precognition for who of us does not assume that good is useful and eligible and in all circumstances that we ought to follow and pursue it and who of us 
does not assume that justice is beautiful and becoming when then does the contradiction arise it arises in the adaptation of the precognitions to the particular cases when one man says he has done well he is a brave man and another says not so but he has acted foolishly then the disputes arise among men this is the dispute among the jews and the syrians and the egyptians and the romans not whether holiness should be preferred to all things and in all cases should be pursued but whether it is holy to eat pigs flesh or not holy you will find this dispute also between agamemnon and achilles for call them forth what do you say agamemnon ought not that to be done which is proper and right certainly well what do you say achilles do you not admit that what is good ought to be done i do most certainly adapt your precognitions then to the present matter here the dispute begins agamemnon says i ought not to give up chryseis to her father achilles says you ought it is certain that one of the two makes a wrong adaptation
 of the precognition of ought or duty further agamemnon says then if i ought to restore chryseis it is fit that i take his prize from some of you achilles replies would you then take her whom i love yes her whom you love must i then be the only man who goes without a prize and must i be the only man who has no prize thus the dispute begins  what then is education education is the learning how to adapt the natural precognitions to the particular things conformably to nature and then to distinguish that of things some are in our power but others are not in our power are will and all acts which depend on the will things not in our power are the body the parts of the body possessions parents brothers children country and generally all with whom we live in society in what then should we place the good to what kind of things οὐσίᾳ shall we adapt it to the things which are in our power is not health then a good thing and soundness of limb and life and are not children and parents and country who will tolerate you if
 you deny this  let us then transfer the notion of good to these things is it possible then when a man sustains damage and does not obtain good things that he can be happy it is not possible and can he maintain towards society a proper behavior he cannot for i am naturally formed to look after my own interest if it is my interest to have an estate in land it is my interest also to take it from my neighbour if it is my interest to have a garment it is my interest also to steal it from the bath this is the origin of wars civil commotions tyrannies conspiracies and how shall i be still able to maintain my duty towards zeus for if i sustain damage and am unlucky he takes no care of me and what is he to me if he cannot help me and further what is he to me if he allows me to be in the condition in which i am i now begin to hate him why then do we build temples why set up statues to zeus as well as to evil demons such as to fever and how is zeus the saviour and how the giver of rain and the giver of fruits and in tr
uth if we place the nature of good in any such things all this follows  what should we do then this is the inquiry of the true philosopher who is in labor now i do not see what the good is nor the bad am i not mad yes but suppose that i place the good somewhere among the things which depend on the will all will laugh at me there will come some greyhead wearing many gold rings on his fingers and he will shake his head and say hear my child it is right that you should philosophize but you ought to have some brains also all this that you are doing is silly you learn the syllogism from philosophers but you know how to act better than philosophers doman why then do you blame me if i know what shall i say to this slave if i am silent he will burst i must speak in this way excuse me as you would excuse lovers i am not my own master i am mad  xxiii against epicurus even epicurus perceives that we are by nature social but having once placed our good in the husk he is no longer able to say anything else for on the othe
r hand he strongly maintains this that we ought not to admire nor to accept anything which is detached from the nature of good and he is right in maintaining this how then are we suspicious if we have no natural affection to our children why do you advise the wise man not to bring up children why are you afraid that he may thus fall into trouble for does he fall into trouble on account of the mouse which is nurtured in the house what does he care if a little mouse in the house makes lamentation to him but epicurus knows that if once a child is born it is no longer in our power not to love it nor care about it for this reason epicurus says that a man who has any sense also does not engage in political matters for he knows what a man must do who is engaged in such things for indeed if you intend to behave among men as you would among a swarm of flies what hinders you but epicurus who knows this ventures to say that we should not bring up children but a sheep does not desert its own offspring nor yet a wolf and 
shall a man desert his child what do you mean that we should be as silly as sheep but not even do they desert their offspring or as savage as wolves but not even do wolves desert their young well who would follow your advice if he saw his child weeping after falling on the ground for my part i think that even if your mother and your father had been told by an oracle that you would say what you have said they would not have cast you away  xxiv how we should struggle with circumstances it is circumstances difficulties which show what men are therefore when a difficulty falls upon you remember that god like a trainer of wrestlers has matched you with a rough young man for what purpose you may say why that you may become an olympic conqueror but it is not accomplished without sweat in my opinion no man has had a more profitable difficulty than you have had if you choose to make use of it as an athlete would deal with a young antagonist we are now sending a scout to rome but no man sends a cowardly scout who if he
 only hears a noise and sees a shadow anywhere comes running back in terror and reports that the enemy is close at hand so now if you should come and tell us fearful is the state of affairs at rome terrible is death terrible is exile terrible is calumny terrible is poverty fly my friends the enemy is near we shall answer be gone prophesy for yourself we have committed only one fault that we sent such a scout  diogenes who was sent as a scout before you made a different report to us he says that death is no evil for neither is it base he says that fame reputation is the noise of madmen and what has this spy said about pain about pleasure and about poverty he says that to be naked is better than any purple robe and to sleep on the bare ground is the softest bed and he gives as a proof of each thing that he affirms his own courage his tranquillity his freedom and the healthy appearance and compactness of his body there is no enemy near he says all is peace how so diogenes see he replies if i am struck if i have 
been wounded if i have fled from any man this is what a scout ought to be but you come to us and tell us one thing after another will you not go back and you will see clearer when you have laid aside fear  what then shall i do what do you do when you leave a ship do you take away the helm or the oars what then do you take away you take what is your own your bottle and your wallet and now if you think of what is your own you will never claim what belongs to others the emperor domitian says lay aside your laticlave see i put on the angusticlave lay aside this also see i have only my toga lay aside your toga see i am now naked but you still raise my envy take then all my poor body when at a mans command i can throw away my poor body do i still fear him  but a certain person will not leave to me the succession to his estate what then had i forgotten that not one of these things was mine how then do we call them mine just as we call the bed in the inn if then the innkeeper at his death leaves you the beds all well
 but if he leaves them to another he will have them and you will seek another bed if then you shall not find one you will sleep on the ground only sleep with a good will and snore and remember that tragedies have their place among the rich and kings and tyrants but no poor man fills a part in a tragedy except as one of the chorus kings indeed commence with prosperity ornament the palace with garlands then about the third or fourth act they call out oh cithaeron why didst thou receive me slave where are the crowns where the diadem the guards help thee not at all when then you approach any of these persons remember this that you are approaching a tragedian not the actor but oedipus himself but you say such a man is happy for he walks about with many and i also place myself with the many and walk about with many in sum remember this the door is open be not more timid than little children but as they say when the thing does not please them i will play no longer so do you when things seem to you of such a kind say
 i will no longer play and be gone but if you stay do not complain  xxv on the same if these things are true and if we are not silly and are not acting hypocritically when we say that the good of man is in the will and the evil too and that everything else does not concern us why are we still disturbed why are we still afraid the things about which we have been busied are in no mans power and the things which are in the power of others we care not for what kind of trouble have we still  but give me directions why should i give you directions has not zeus given you directions has he not given to you what is your own free from hindrance and free from impediment and what is not your own subject to hindrance and impediment what directions then what kind of orders did you bring when you came from him keep by every means what is your own do not desire what belongs to others fidelity integrity is your own virtuous shame is your own who then can take these things from you who else than yourself will hinder you from u
sing them but how do you act when you seek what is not your own you lose that which is your own having such promptings and commands from zeus what kind do you still ask from me am i more powerful than he am i more worthy of confidence but if you observe these do you want any others besides well but he has not given these orders you will say produce your precognitions προλήψεις produce the proofs of philosophers produce what you have often heard and produce what you have said yourself produce what you have read produce what you have meditated on and you will then see that all these things are from god how long then is it fit to observe these precepts from god and not to break up the play as long as the play is continued with propriety in the saturnalia a king is chosen by lot for it has been the custom to play at this game the king commands do you drink do you mix the wine do you sing do you go do you come i obey that the game may not be broken up through mebut if he says think that you are in evil plight i an
swer i do not think so and who will compel me to think so further we agreed to play agamemnon and achilles he who is appointed to play agamemnon says to me go to achilles and tear from him briseis i go he says come and i come  for as we behave in the matter of hypothetical arguments so ought we to do in life suppose it to be night i suppose that it is night well then is it day no for i admitted the hypothesis that it was night suppose that you think that it is night suppose that i do but also think that it is night that is not consistent with the hypothesis so in this case also suppose that you are unfortunate well suppose so are you then unhappy yes well then are you troubled with an unfavorable daemon fortune yes but think also that you are in misery this is not consistent with the hypothesis and another zeus forbids me to think so  how long then must we obey such orders as long as it is profitable and this means as long as i maintain that which is becoming and consistent further some men are sour and of ba
d temper and they say i cannot sup with this man to be obliged to hear him telling daily how he fought in mysia i told you brother how i ascended the hill then i began to be besieged again but another says i prefer to get my supper and to hear him talk as much as he likes and do you compare these estimates judgments only do nothing in a depressed mood nor as one afflicted nor as thinking that you are in misery for no man compels you to thathas it smoked in the chamber if the smoke is moderate i will stay if it is excessive i go out for you must always remember this and hold it fast that the door is openwell but you say to me do not live in nicopolis i will not live there nor in athens i will not live in athens nor in rome i will not live in rome live in gyarus i will live in gyarus but it seems like a great smoke to live in gyarus and i depart to the place where no man will hinder me from living for that dwelling place is open to all and as to the last garment that is the poor body no one has any power over m
e beyond this this was the reason why demetrius said to nero you threaten me with death but nature threatens you if i set my admiration on the poor body i have given myself up to be a slave if on my little possessions i also make myself a slave for i immediately make it plain with what i may be caught as if the snake draws in his head i tell you to strike that part of him which he guards and do you be assured that whatever part you choose to guard that part your master will attack remembering this whom will you still flatter or fear  but i should like to sit where the senators sit do you see that you are putting yourself in straits you are squeezing yourself how then shall i see well in any other way in the amphitheatre man do not be a spectator at all and you will not be squeezed why do you give yourself trouble or wait a little and when the spectacle is over seat yourself in the place reserved for the senators and sun yourself for remember this general truth that it is we who squeeze ourselves who put ourse
lves in straits that is our opinions squeeze us and put us in straits for what is it to be reviled stand by a stone and revile it and what will you gain if then a man listens like a stone what profit is there to the reviler but if the reviler has as a steppingstone or ladder the weakness of him who is reviled then he accomplishes somethingstrip himwhat do you mean by himlay hold of his garment strip it off i have insulted you much good may it do you  this was the practice of socrates this was the reason why he always had one face but we choose to practice and study anything rather than the means by which we shall be unimpeded and free you say philosophers talk paradoxes but are there no paradoxes in the other arts and what is more paradoxical than to puncture a mans eye in order that he may see if anyone said this to a man ignorant of the surgical art would he not ridicule the speaker where is the wonder then if in philosophy also many things which are true appear paradoxical to the inexperienced  xxvi what i
s the law of life when a person was reading hypothetical arguments epictetus said this also is a hypothetical law that we must accept what follows from the hypothesis but much before this law is the law of life that we must act conformably to nature for if in every matter and circumstance we wish to observe what is natural it is plain that in everything we ought to make it our aim that neither that which is consequent shall escape us and that we do not admit the contradictory first then philosophers exercise us in theory contemplation of things which is easier and then next they lead us to the more difficult things for in theory there is nothing which draws us away from following what is taught but in the matters of life many are the things which distract us he is ridiculous then who says that he wishes to begin with the matters of real life for it is not easy to begin with the more difficult things and we ought to employ this fact as an argument to those parents who are vexed at their children learning philo
sophy am i doing wrong then my father and do i not know what is suitable to me and becoming if indeed this can neither be learned nor taught why do you blame me but if it can be taught teach me and if you cannot allow me to learn from those who say that they know how to teach for what do you think do you suppose that i voluntarily fall into evil and miss the good i hope that it may not be so what is then the cause of my doing wrong ignorance do you not choose then that i should get rid of my ignorance who was ever taught by anger the art of a pilot or music do you think then that by means of your anger i shall learn the art of life he only is allowed to speak in this way who has shown such an intention but if a man only intending to make a display at a banquet and to show that he is acquainted with hypothetical arguments reads them and attends the philosophers what other object has he than that some man of senatorian rank who sits by him may admire for there at rome are the really great materials opportunitie
s and the riches here at nicopolis appear to be trifles there this is the reason why it is difficult for a man to be master of the appearances where the things which disturb the judgment are great i know a certain person who complained as he embraced the knees of epaphroditus that he had only one hundred and fifty times ten thousand denarii remaining what then did epaphroditus do did he laugh at him as we slaves of epaphroditus did no but he cried out with amazement poor man how then did you keep silence how did you endure it  when epictetus had reproved called the person who was reading the hypothetical arguments and the teacher who had suggested the reading was laughing at the reader epictetus said to the teacher you are laughing at yourself you did not prepare the young man nor did you ascertain whether he was able to understand these matters but perhaps you are only employing him as a reader well then said epictetus if a man has not ability enough to understand a complex syllogism do we trust him in givin
g praise do we trust him in giving blame do we allow that he is able to form a judgment about good or bad and if such a man blames anyone does the man care for the blame and if he praises anyone is the man elated when in such small matters as a hypothetical syllogism he who praises cannot see what is consequent on the hypothesis  this then is the beginning of philosophy a mans perception of the state of his ruling faculty for when a man knows that it is weak then he will not employ it on things of the greatest difficulty but at present if men cannot swallow even a morsel they buy whole volumes and attempt to devour them and this is the reason why they vomit them up or suffer indigestion and then come gripings defluxes and fevers such men ought to consider what their ability is in theory it is easy to convince an ignorant person but in the affairs of real life no one offers himself to be convinced and we hate the man who has convinced us but socrates advised us not to live a life which is not subjected to exam
ination  xxvii in how many ways appearances exist and what aids we should provide against them appearances are to us in four ways for either things appear as they are or they are not and do not even appear to be or they are and do not appear to be or they are not and yet appear to be further in all these cases to form a right judgment to hit the mark is the office of an educated man but whatever it is that annoys troubles us to that we ought to apply a remedy if the sophisms of pyrrho and of the academics are what annoys troubles we must apply the remedy to them if it is the persuasion of appearances by which some things appear to be good when they are not good let us seek a remedy for this if it is habit which annoys us we must try to seek aid against habit what aid then can we find against habit the contrary habit you hear the ignorant say that unfortunate person is dead his father and mother are overpowered with sorrow he was cut off by an untimely death and in a foreign land hear the contrary way of speak
ing tear yourself from these expressions oppose to one habit the contrary habit to sophistry oppose reason and the exercise and discipline of reason against persuasive deceitful appearances we ought to have manifest precognitions προλήψεις cleared of all impurities and ready to hand  when death appears an evil we ought to have this rule in readiness that it is fit to avoid evil things and that death is a necessary thing for what shall i do and where shall i escape it suppose that i am not sarpedon the son of zeus nor able to speak in this noble way i will go and i am resolved either to behave bravely myself or to give to another the opportunity of doing so if i cannot succeed in doing anything myself i will not grudge another the doing of something noblesuppose that it is above our power to act thus is it not in our power to reason thus tell me where i can escape death discover for me the country show me the men to whom i must go whom death does not visit discover to me a charm against death if i have not one
 what do you wish me to do i cannot escape from death shall i not escape from the fear of death but shall i die lamenting and trembling for the origin of perturbation is this to wish for something and that this should not happen therefore if i am able to change externals according to my wish i change them but if i cannot i am ready to tear out the eyes of him who hinders me for the nature of man is not to endure to be deprived of the good and not to endure the falling into the evil then at last when i am neither able to change circumstances nor to tear out the eyes of him who hinders me i sit down and groan and abuse whom i can zeus and the rest of the gods for if they do not care for me what are they to meyes but you will be an impious manin what respect then will it be worse for me than it is nowto sum up remember this that unless piety and your interest be in the same thing piety cannot be maintained in any man do not these things seem necessary true  let the followers of pyrrho and the academics come and 
make their objections for i as to my part have no leisure for these disputes nor am i able to undertake the defense of common consent opinion if i had a suit even about a bit of land i would call in another to defend my interests with what evidence then am i satisfied with that which belongs to the matter in hand how indeed perception is effected whether through the whole body or any part perhaps i cannot explain for both opinions perplex me but that you and i are not the same i know with perfect certainty how do you know it when i intend to swallow anything i never carry it to your mouth but to my own when i intend to take bread i never lay hold of a broom but i always go to the bread as to a mark and you yourselves the pyrrhonists who take away the evidence of the senses do you act otherwise who among you when he intended to enter a bath ever went into a mill  what then ought we not with all our power to hold to this also the maintaining of general opinion and fortifying ourselves against the arguments whic
h are directed against it who denies that we ought to do this well he should do it who is able who has leisure for it but as to him who trembles and is perturbed and is inwardly broken in heart spirit he must employ his time better on something else  xxviii that we ought not to be angry with men and what are the small and the great things among men what is the cause of assenting to anything the fact that it appears to be true it is not possible then to assent to that which appears not to be true why because this is the nature of the understanding to incline to the true to be dissatisfied with the false and in matters uncertain to withhold assent what is the proof of this imagine persuade yourself if you can that it is now night it is not possible take away your persuasion that it is day it is not possible persuade yourself or take away your persuasion that the stars are even in number it is impossible when then any man assents to that which is false be assured that he did not intend to assent to it as false f
or every soul is unwillingly deprived of the truth as plato says but the falsity seemed to him to be true well in acts what have we of the like kind as we have here truth or falsehood we have the fit and the not fit duty and not duty the profitable and the unprofitable that which is suitable to a person and that which is not and whatever is like these can then a man think that a thing is useful to him and not choose it he cannot how says medea  tis true i know what evil i shall do but passion overpowers the better counsel she thought that to indulge her passion and take vengeance on her husband was more profitable than to spare her children it was so but she was deceived show her plainly that she is deceived and she will not do it but so long as you do not show it what can she follow except that which appears to herself her opinion nothing else why then are you angry with the unhappy woman that she has been bewildered about the most important things and is become a viper instead of a human creature and why no
t if it is possible rather pity as we pity the blind and the lame so those who are blinded and maimed in the faculties which are supreme  whoever then clearly remembers this that to man the measure of every act is the appearance the opinionwhether the thing appears good or bad if good he is free from blame if bad himself suffers the penalty for it is impossible that he who is deceived can be one person and he who suffers another personwhoever remembers this will not be angry with any man will not be vexed at any man will not revile or blame any man nor hate nor quarrel with any man  so then all these great and dreadful deeds have this origin in the appearance opinion yes this origin and no other the iliad is nothing else than appearance and the use of appearances it appeared to alexander to carry off the wife of menelaus it appeared to helene to follow him if then it had appeared to menelaus to feel that it was a gain to be deprived of such a wife what would have happened not only would the iliad have been lo
st but the odyssey also on so small a matter then did such great things depend but what do you mean by such great things wars and civil commotions and the destruction of many men and cities and what great matter is this is it nothingbut what great matter is the death of many oxen and many sheep and many nests of swallows or storks being burnt or destroyed are these things then like those very like bodies of men are destroyed and the bodies of oxen and sheep the dwellings of men are burnt and the nests of storks what is there in this great or dreadful or show me what is the difference between a mans house and a storks nest as far as each is a dwelling except that man builds his little houses of beams and tiles and bricks and the stork builds them of sticks and mud are a stork and a man then like things what say youin body they are very much alike  does a man then differ in no respect from a stork dont suppose that i say so but there is no difference in these matters which i have mentioned in what then is the d
ifference seek and you will find that there is a difference in another matter see whether it is not in a man the understanding of what he does see if it is not in social community in fidelity in modesty in steadfastness in intelligence where then is the great good and evil in men it is where the difference is if the difference is preserved and remains fenced round and neither modesty is destroyed nor fidelity nor intelligence then the man also is preserved but if any of these things is destroyed and stormed like a city then the man too perishes and in this consist the great things alexander you say sustained great damage then when the hellenes invaded and when they ravaged troy and when his brothers perished by no means for no man is damaged by an action which is not his own but what happened at that time was only the destruction of storks nests now the ruin of alexander was when he lost the character of modesty fidelity regard to hospitality and to decency when was achilles ruined was it when patroclus died 
not so but it happened when he began to be angry when he wept for a girl when he forgot that he was at troy not to get mistresses but to fight these things are the ruin of men this is being besieged this is the destruction of cities when right opinions are destroyed when they are corrupted  when then women are carried off when children are made captives and when the men are killed are these not evils how is it then that you add to the facts these opinions explain this to me alsoi shall not do that but how is it that you say that these are not evilslet us come to the rules produce the precognitions προλήψεις for it is because this is neglected that we cannot sufficiently wonder at what men do when we intend to judge of weights we do not judge by guess where we intend to judge of straight and crooked we do not judge by guess in all cases where it is our interest to know what is true in any matter never will any man among us do anything by guess but in things which depend on the first and on the only cause of do
ing right or wrong of happiness or unhappiness of being unfortunate or fortunate there only we are inconsiderate and rash there is then nothing like scales balance nothing like a rule but some appearance is presented and straightway i act according to it must i then suppose that i am superior to achilles or agamemnon so that they by following appearances do and suffer so many evils and shall not the appearance be sufficient for meand what tragedy has any other beginning the atreus of euripides what is it an appearance the oedipus of sophocles what is it an appearance the phoenix an appearance the hippolytus an appearance what kind of a man then do you suppose him to be who pays no regard to this matter and what is the name of those who follow every appearance they are called madmen do we then act at all differently  xxix on constancy or firmness the being nature of the good is a certain will the being of the bad is a certain kind of will what then are externals materials for the will about which the will bein
g conversant shall obtain its own good or evil how shall it obtain the good if it does not admire overvalue the materials for the opinions about the materials if the opinions are right make the will good but perverse and distorted opinions make the will bad god has fixed this law and says if you would have anything good receive it from yourself you say no but i will have it from another do not so but receive it from yourself therefore when the tyrant threatens and calls me i say whom do you threaten if he says i will put you in chains i say you threaten my hands and my feet if he says i will cut off your head i reply you threaten my head if he says i will throw you into prison i say you threaten the whole of this poor body if he threatens me with banishment i say the same does he then not threaten you at all if i feel that all these things do not concern me he does not threaten me at all but if i fear any of them it is i whom he threatens whom then do i fear the master of what the master of things which are i
n my own power there is no such master do i fear the master of things which are not in my power and what are these things to me  do you philosophers then teach us to despise kings i hope not who among us teaches to claim against them the power over things which they possess take my poor body take my property take my reputation take those who are about me if i advise any persons to claim these things they may truly accuse me yes but i intend to command your opinions also and who has given you this power how can you conquer the opinion of another man by applying terror to it he replies i will conquer it do you not know that opinion conquers itself and is not conquered by another but nothing else can conquer will except the will itself for this reason too the law of god is most powerful and most just which is this let the stronger always be superior to the weaker ten are stronger than one for what for putting in chains for killing for dragging whither they choose for taking away what a man has the ten therefore 
conquer the one in this in which they are stronger in what then are the ten weaker if the one possesses right opinions and the others do not well then can the ten conquer in this matter how is it possible if we were placed in the scales must not the heavier draw down the scale in which it is  how strange then that socrates should have been so treated by the athenians slave why do you say socrates speak of the thing as it is how strange that the poor body of socrates should have been carried off and dragged to prison by stronger men and that anyone should have given hemlock to the poor body of socrates and that it should breathe out the life do these things seem strange do they seem unjust do you on account of these things blame god had socrates then no equivalent for these things where then for him was the nature of good whom shall we listen to you or him and what does socrates say anytus and melitus can kill me but they cannot hurt me and further he says if it so pleases god so let it be  but show me that he
 who has the inferior principles overpowers him who is superior in principles you will never show this nor come near showing it for this is the law of nature and of god that the superior shall always overpower the inferior in what in that in which it is superior one body is stronger than another many are stronger than one the thief is stronger than he who is not a thief this is the reason why i also lost my lamp because in wakefulness the thief was superior to me but the man bought the lamp at this price for a lamp he became a thief a faithless fellow and like a wild beast this seemed to him a good bargain be it so but a man has seized me by the cloak and is drawing me to the public place then others bawl out philosopher what has been the use of your opinions see you are dragged to prison you are going to be beheaded and what system of philosophy εἰσαγωγήν could i have made so that if a stronger man should have laid hold of my cloak i should not be dragged off that if ten men should have laid hold of me and c
ast me into prison i should not be cast in have i learned nothing else then i have learned to see that everything which happens if it be independent of my will is nothing to me i may ask if you have not gained by this why then do you seek advantage in anything else than in that in which you have learned that advantage is  then sitting in prison i say the man who cries out in this way neither hears what words mean nor understands what is said nor does he care at all to know what philosophers say or what they do let him alone  but now he says to the prisoner come out from your prisonif you have no further need of me in prison i come out if you should have need of me again i will enter the prisonhow long will you act thusso long as reason requires me to be with the body but when reason does not require this take away the body and fare you well only we must not do it inconsiderately nor weakly nor for any slight reason for on the other hand god does not wish it to be done and he has need of such a world and such 
inhabitants in it but if he sounds the signal for retreat as he did to socrates we must obey him who gives the signal as if he were a general  well then ought we to say such things to the many why should we is it not enough for a man to be persuaded himself when children come clapping their hands and crying out today is the good saturnalia do we say the saturnalia are not good by no means but we clap our hands also do you also then when you are not able to make a man change his mind be assured that he is a child and clap your hands with him and if you do not choose to do this keep silent  a man must keep this in mind and when he is called to any such difficulty he should know that the time is come for showing if he has been instructed for he who is come into a difficulty is like a young man from a school who has practiced the resolution of syllogisms and if any person proposes to him an easy syllogism he says rather propose to me a syllogism which is skillfully complicated that i may exercise myself on it eve
n athletes are dissatisfied with slight young men and say he cannot lift methis is a youth of noble disposition you do not so but when the time of trial is come one of you must weep and say i wish that i had learned more a little more of what if you did not learn these things in order to show them in practice why did you learn them i think that there is someone among you who are sitting here who is suffering like a woman in labor and saying oh that such a difficulty does not present itself to me as that which has come to this man oh that i should be wasting my life in a corner when i might be crowned at olympia when will anyone announce to me such a contest such ought to be the disposition of all of you even among the gladiators of caesar the emperor there are some who complain grievously that they are not brought forward and matched and they offer up prayers to god and address themselves to their superintendents entreating that they may fight and will no one among you show himself such i would willingly take
 a voyage to rome for this purpose and see what my athlete is doing how he is studying his subjecti do not choose such a subject he says why is it in your power to take what subject you choose there has been given to you such a body as you have such parents such brethren such a country such a place in your countrythen you come to me and say change my subject have you not abilities which enable you to manage the subject which has been given to you you ought to say it is your business to propose it is mine to exercise myself well however you do not say so but you say do not propose to me such a tropic but such as i would choose do not urge against me such an objection but such as i would choose there will be a time perhaps when tragic actors will suppose that they are only masks and buskins and the long cloak i say these things man are your material and subject utter something that we may know whether you are a tragic actor or a buffoon for both of you have all the rest in common if anyone then should take away
 the tragic actors buskins and his mask and introduce him on the stage as a phantom is the tragic actor lost or does he still remain if he has voice he still remains  an example of another kind assume the governorship of a province i assume it and when i have assumed it i show how an instructed man behaves lay aside the laticlave the mark of senatorial rank and clothing yourself in rags come forward in this character what then have i not the power of displaying a good voice that is of doing something that i ought to do how then do you now appear on the stage of life as a witness summoned by god come forward you and bear testimony for me for you are worthy to be brought forward as a witness by me is anything external to the will good or bad do i hurt any man have i made every mans interest dependent on any man except himself what testimony do you give for godi am in a wretched condition master lord and i am unfortunate no man cares for me no man gives me anything all blame me all steak ill of meis this the evi
dence that you are going to give and disgrace his summons who has conferred so much honor on you and thought you worthy of being called to bear such testimony  but suppose that he who has the power has declared i judge you to be impious and profane what has happened to you i have been judged to be impious and profane nothing else nothing else but if the same person had passed judgment on a hypothetical syllogism συνημμένου and had made a declaration the conclusion that if it is day it is light i declare to be false what has happened to the hypothetical syllogism who is judged in this case who has been condemned the hypothetical syllogism or the man who has been deceived by it does he then who has the power of making any declaration about you know what is pious or impious has he studied it and has he learned it where from whom then is it the fact that a musician pays no regard to him who declares that the lowest chord in the lyre is the highest nor yet a geometrician if he declares that the lines from the cent
re of a circle to the circumference are not equal and shall he who is really instructed pay any regard to the uninstructed man when he pronounces judgment on what is pious and what is impious on what is just and unjust oh the signal wrong done by the instructed did they learn this here  will you not leave the small arguments λογάρια about these matters to others to lazy fellows that they may sit in a corner and receive their sorry pay or grumble that no one gives them anything and will you not come forward and make use of what you have learned for it is not these small arguments that are wanted now the writings of the stoics are full of them what then is the thing which is wanted a man who shall apply them one who by his acts shall bear testimony to his words assume i entreat you this character that we may no longer use in the schools the examples of the ancients but may have some example of our own  to whom then does the contemplation of these matters philosophical inquiries belong to him who has leisure for
 man is an animal that loves contemplation but it is shameful to contemplate these things as runaway slaves do we should sit as in a theatre free from distraction and listen at one time to the tragic actor at another time to the luteplayer and not do as slaves do as soon as the slave has taken his station he praises the actor and at the same time looks round then if anyone calls out his masters name the slave is immediately frightened and disturbed it is shameful for philosophers thus to contemplate the works of nature for what is a master man is not the master of man but death is and life and pleasure and pain for if he comes without these things bring caesar to me and you will see how firm i am but when he shall come with these things thundering and lightning and when i am afraid of them what do i do then except to recognize my master like the runaway slave but so long as i have any respite from these terrors as a runaway slave stands in the theatre so do i i bathe i drink i sing but all this i do with terr
or and uneasiness but if i shall release myself from my masters that is from those things by means of which masters are formidable what further trouble have i what master have i still  what then ought we to publish these things to all men no but we ought to accommodate ourselves to the ignorant τοῖς ἰδιώταις and to say this man recommends to me that which he thinks good for himself i excuse him for socrates also excused the jailor who had the charge of him in prison and was weeping when socrates was going to drink the poison and said how generously he laments over us does he then say to the jailor that for this reason we have sent away the women no but he says it to his friends who were able to hear understand it and he treats the jailor as a child  xxx what we ought to have ready in difficult circumstances when you are going in to any great personage remember that another also from above sees what is going on and that you ought to please him rather than the other he then who sees from above asks you in the s
chools what used you to say about exile and bonds and death and disgrace i used to say that they are things indifferent neither good nor bad what then do you say of them now are they changed at all no are you changed then no tell me then what things are indifferent the things which are independent of the will tell me also what follows from this the things which are independent of the will are nothing to me tell me also about the good what was your opinion a will such as we ought to have and also such a use of appearances and the end purpose what is it to follow thee do you say this now also i say the same now also  then go in to the great personage boldly and remember these things and you will see what a youth is who has studied these things when he is among men who have not studied them i indeed imagine that you will have such thoughts as these why do we make so great and so many preparations for nothing is this the thing which men name power is this the antechamber this the men of the bedchamber this the ar
med guards is it for this that i listened to so many discourses all this is nothing but i have been preparing myself as for something great  book ii i that confidence courage is not inconsistent with caution the opinion of the philosophers perhaps seems to some to be a paradox but still let us examine as well as we can if it is true that it is possible to do everything both with caution and with confidence for caution seems to be in a manner contrary to confidence and contraries are in no way consistent that which seems to many to be a paradox in the matter under consideration in my opinion is of this kind if we asserted that we ought to employ caution and confidence in the same things men might justly accuse us of bringing together things which cannot be united but now where is the difficulty in what is said for if these things are true which have been often said and often proved that the nature of good is in the use of appearances and the nature of evil likewise and that things independent of our will do no
t admit either the nature of evil nor of good what paradox do the philosophers assert if they say that where things are not dependent on the will there you should employ confidence but where they are dependent on the will there you should employ caution for if the bad consists in a bad exercise of the will caution ought only to be used where things are dependent on the will but if things independent of the will and not in our power are nothing to us with respect to these we must employ confidence and thus we shall both be cautious and confident and indeed confident because of our caution for by employing caution towards things which are really bad it will result that we shall have confidence with respect to things which are not so  we are then in the condition of deer when they flee from the huntsmens feathers in fright whither do they turn and in what do they seek refuge as safe they turn to the nets and thus they perish by confounding things which are objects of fear with things that they ought not to fear 
thus we also act in what cases do we fear in things which are independent of the will in what cases on the contrary do we behave with confidence as if there were no danger in things dependent on the will to be deceived then or to act rashly or shamelessly or with base desire to seek something does not concern us at all if we only hit the mark in things which are independent of our will but where there is death or exile or pain or infamy there we attempt to run away there we are struck with terror therefore as we may expect it to happen with those who err in the greatest matters we convert natural confidence that is according to nature into audacity desperation rashness shamelessness and we convert natural caution and modesty into cowardice and meanness which are full of fear and confusion for if a man should transfer caution to those things in which the will may be exercised and the acts of the will he will immediately by willing to be cautious have also the power of avoiding what he chooses but if he transfe
r it to the things which are not in his power and will and attempt to avoid the things which are in the power of others he will of necessity fear he will be unstable he will be disturbed for death or pain is not formidable but the fear of pain or death for this reason we commend the poet who said  not death is evil but a shameful death confidence courage then ought to be employed against death and caution against the fear of death but now we do the contrary and employ against death the attempt to escape and to our opinion about it we employ carelessness rashness and indifference these things socrates properly used to call tragic masks for as to children masks appear terrible and fearful from inexperience we also are affected in like manner by events the things which happen in life for no other reason than children are by masks for what is a child ignorance what is a child want of knowledge for when a child knows these things he is in no way inferior to us what is death a tragic mask turn it and examine it see
 it does not bite the poor body must be separated from the spirit either now or later as it was separated from it before why then are you troubled if it be separated now for if it is not separated now it will be separated afterwards why that the period of the universe may be completed for it has need of the present and of the future and of the past what is pain a mask turn it and examine it the poor flesh is moved roughly then on the contrary smoothly if this does not satisfy please you the door is open if it does bear with things for the door ought to be open for all occasions and so we have no trouble  what then is the fruit of these opinions it is that which ought to be the most noble and the most becoming to those who are really educated release from perturbation release from fear freedom for in these matters we must not believe the many who say that free persons only ought to be educated but we should rather believe the philosophers who say that the educated only are free how is this in this manner is fr
eedom anything else than the power of living as we choose nothing else tell me then ye men do you wish to live in error we do not no one then who lives in error is free do you wish to live in fear do you wish to live in sorrow do you wish to live in perturbation by no means no one then who is in a state of fear or sorrow or perturbation is free but whoever is delivered from sorrows and fears and perturbations he is at the same time also delivered from servitude how then can we continue to believe you most dear legislators when you say we only allow free persons to be educated for philosophers say we allow none to be free except the educated that is god does not allow it when then a man has turned round before the praetor his own slave has he done nothing he has done something what he has turned round his own slave before the praetor has he done nothing more yes he is also bound to pay for him the tax called the twentieth well then is not the man who has gone through this ceremony become free no more than he i
s become free from perturbations have you who are able to turn round free others no master is not money your master or a girl or a boy or some tyrant or some friend of the tyrant why do you tremble then when you are going off to any trial danger of this kind it is for this reason that i often say study and hold in readiness these principles by which you may determine what those things are with reference to which you ought to have confidence courage and those things with reference to which you ought to be cautiouscourageous in that which does not depend on your will cautious in that which does depend on it  well have i not read to you and do you not know what i was doing in what in my little dissertationsshow me how you are with respect to desire and aversion ἔκκλισιν and show me if you do not fail in getting what you wish and if you do not fall into the things which you would avoid but as to these long and labored sentences you will take them and blot them out  what then did not socrates write and who wrote s
o muchbut how as he could not always have at hand one to argue against his principles or to be argued against in turn he used to argue with and examine himself and he was always treating at least some one subject in a practical way these are the things which a philosopher writes but little dissertations and that method which i speak of he leaves to others to the stupid or to those happy men who being free from perturbations have leisure or to such as are too foolish to reckon consequences  and will you now when the opportunity invites go and display those things which you possess and recite them and make an idle show and say see how i make dialogues do not so my man but rather say see how i am not disappointed of that which i desire see how i do not fall into that which i would avoid set death before me and you will see set before me pain prison disgrace and condemnation this is the proper display of a young man who is come out of the schools but leave the rest to others and let no one ever hear you say a wor
d about these things and if any man commends you for them do not allow it but think that you are nobody and know nothing only show that you know this how never to be disappointed in your desire and how never to fall into that which you would avoid let others labor at forensic causes problems and syllogisms do you labor at thinking about death chains the rack exile and do all this with confidence and reliance on him who has called you to these sufferings who has judged you worthy of the place in which being stationed you will show what things the rational governing power can do when it takes its stand against the forces which are not within the power of our will and thus this paradox will no longer appear either impossible or a paradox that a man ought to be at the same time cautious and courageouscourageous towards the things which do not depend on the will and cautious in things which are within the power of the will  ii of tranquillity freedom from perturbation consider you who are going into court what you
 wish to maintain and what you wish to succeed in for if you wish to maintain a will conformable to nature you have every security every facility you have no troubles for if you wish to maintain what is in your own power and is naturally free and if you are content with these what else do you care for for who is the master of such things who can take them away if you choose to be modest and faithful who shall not allow you to be so if you choose not to be restrained or compelled who shall compel you to desire what you think that you ought not to desire who shall compel you to avoid what you do not think fit to avoid but what do you say the judge will determine against you something that appears formidable but that you should also suffer in trying to avoid it how can he do that when then the pursuit of objects and the avoiding of them are in your power what else do you care for let this be your preface this your narrative this your confirmation this your victory this your peroration this your applause or the a
pprobation which you will receive  therefore socrates said to one who was reminding him to prepare for his trial do you not think then that i have been preparing for it all my life by what kind of preparation i have maintained that which was in my own power how then i have never done anything unjust either in my private or in my public life  but if you wish to maintain externals alsoyour poor body your little property and your little estimationi advise you to make from this moment all possible preparation and then consider both the nature of your judge and your adversary if it is necessary to embrace his knees embrace his knees if to weep weep if to groan groan for when you have subjected to externals what is your own then be a slave and do not resist and do not sometimes choose to be a slave and sometimes not choose but with all your mind be one or the other either free or a slave either instructed or uninstructed either a well bred cock or a mean one either endure to be beaten until you die or yield at once
 and let it not happen to you to receive many stripes and then to yield but if these things are base determine immediately where is the nature of evil and good it is where truth is where truth is and where nature is there is caution where truth is there is courage where nature is  for what do you think do you think that if socrates had wished to preserve externals he would have come forward and said anytus and melitus can certainly kill me but to harm me they are not able was he so foolish as not to see that this way leads not to the preservation of life and fortune but to another end what is the reason then that he takes no account of his adversaries and even irritates them just in the same way my friend heraclitus who had a little suit in rhodes about a bit of land and had proved to the judges δικασταῖς that his case was just said when he had come to the peroration of his speech i will neither entreat you nor do i care what judgment you will give and it is you rather than i who are on your trial and thus he
 ended the business what need was there of this only do not entreat but do not also say i do not entreat unless there is a fit occasion to irritate purposely the judges as was the case with socrates and you if you are preparing such a peroration why do you wait why do you obey the order to submit to trial for if you wish to be crucified wait and the cross will come but if you choose to submit and to plead your cause as well as you can you must do what is consistent with this object provided you maintain what is your own your proper character  for this reason also it is ridiculous to say suggest something to me tell me what to do what should i suggest to you well form my mind so as to accommodate itself to any event why that is just the same as if a man who is ignorant of letters should say tell me what to write when any name is proposed to me for if i should tell him to write dion and then another should come and propose to him not the name of dion but that of theon what will be done what will he write but if
 you have practiced writing you are also prepared to write or to do anything that is required if you are not what can i now suggest for if circumstances require something else what will you say or what will you do remember then this general precept and you will need no suggestion but if you gape after externals you must of necessity ramble up and down in obedience to the will of your master and who is the master he who has the power over the things which you seek to gain or try to avoid  iii to those who recommend persons to philosophers diogenes said well to one who asked from him letters of recommendation that you are a man he said he will know as soon as he sees you and he will know whether you are good or bad if he is by experience skillful to distinguish the good and the bad but if he is without experience he will never know if i write to him ten thousand times for it is just the same as if a drachma a piece of silver money asked to be recommended to a person to be tested if he is skillful in testing sil
ver he will know what you are for you the drachma will recommend yourself we ought then in life also to have some skill as in the case of silver coin that a man may be able to say like the judge of silver bring me any drachma and i will test it but in the case of syllogisms i would say bring any man that you please and i will distinguish for you the man who knows how to resolve syllogisms and the man who does not why because i know how to resolve syllogisms i have the power which a man must have who is able to discover those who have the power of resolving syllogisms but in life how do i act at one time i call a thing good and at another time bad what is the reason the contrary to that which is in the case of syllogisms ignorance and inexperience  iv against a person who had once been detected in adultery as epictetus was saying that man is formed for fidelity and that he who subverts fidelity subverts the peculiar characteristic of men there entered one of those who are considered to be men of letters who ha
d once been detected in adultery in the city then epictetus continued but if we lay aside this fidelity for which we are formed and make designs against our neighbours wife what are we doing what else but destroying and overthrowing whom the man of fidelity the man of modesty the man of sanctity is this all and are we not overthrowing neighbourhood and friendship and the community and in what place are we putting ourselves how shall i consider you man as a neighbour as a friend what kind of one as a citizen wherein shall i trust you so if you were an utensil so worthless that a man could not use you you would be pitched out on the dung heaps and no man would pick you up but if being a man you are unable to fill any place which befits a man what shall we do with you for suppose that you cannot hold the place of a friend can you hold the place of a slave and who will trust you are you not then content that you also should be pitched somewhere on a dung heap as a useless utensil and a bit of dung then will you s
ay no man cares for me a man of letters they do not because you are bad and useless it is just as if the wasps complained because no man cares for them but all fly from them and if a man can he strikes them and knocks them down you have such a sting that you throw into trouble and pain any man that you wound with it what would you have us do with you you have no place where you can be put  what then are not women common by nature so i say also for a little pig is common to all the invited guests but when the portions have been distributed go if you think it right and snatch up the portion of him who reclines next to you or slyly steal it or place your hand down by it and lay hold of it and if you cannot tear away a bit of the meat grease your fingers and lick them a fine companion over cups and socratic guest indeed well is not the theatre common to the citizens when then they have taken their seats come if you think proper and eject one of them in this way women also are common by nature when then the legisl
ator like the master of a feast has distributed them will you not also look for your own portion and not filch and handle what belongs to another but i am a man of letters and understand archedemus understand archedemus then and be an adulterer and faithless and instead of a man be a wolf or an ape for what is the difference  v how magnanimity is consistent with care things themselves materials are indifferent but the use of them is not indifferent how then shall a man preserve firmness and tranquillity and at the same time be careful and neither rash nor negligent if he imitates those who play at dice the counters are indifferent the dice are indifferent how do i know what the cast will be but to use carefully and dexterously the cast of the dice this is my business thus then in life also the chief business is this distinguish and separate things and say externals are not in my power will is in my power where shall i seek the good and the bad within in the things which are my own but in what does not belong 
to you call nothing either good or bad or profit or damage or anything of the kind  what then should we use such things carelessly in no way for this on the other hand is bad for the faculty of the will and consequently against nature but we should act carefully because the use is not indifferent and we should also act with firmness and freedom from perturbations because the material is indifferent for where the material is not indifferent there no man can hinder me nor compel me where i can be hindered and compelled the obtaining of those things is not in my power nor is it good or bad but the use is either bad or good and the use is in my power but it is difficult to mingle and to bring together these two things the carefulness of him who is affected by the matter or things about him and the firmness of him who has no regard for it but it is not impossible and if it is happiness is impossible but we should act as we do in the case of a voyage what can i do i can choose the master of the ship the sailors the
 day the opportunity then comes a storm what more have i to care for for my part is done the business belongs to another the masterbut the ship is sinkingwhat then have i to do i do the only thing that i can not to be drowned full of fear nor screaming nor blaming god but knowing that what has been produced must also perish for i am not an immortal being but a man a part of the whole as an hour is a part of the day i must be present like the hour and past like the hour what difference then does it make to me how i pass away whether by being suffocated or by a fever for i must pass through some such means  this is just what you will see those doing who play at ball skillfully no one cares about the ball as being good or bad but about throwing and catching it in this therefore is the skill in this the art the quickness the judgment so that even if i spread out my lap i may not be able to catch it and another if i throw may catch the ball but if with perturbation and fear we receive or throw the ball what kind o
f play is it then and wherein shall a man be steady and how shall a man see the order in the game but one will say throw or do not throw and another will say you have thrown once this is quarrelling not play  socrates then knew how to play at ball how by using pleasantry in the court where he was tried tell me he says anytus how do you say that i do not believe in god the daemons δαίμονες who are they think you are they not sons of gods or compounded of gods and men when anytus admitted this socrates said who then think you can believe that there are mules half asses but not asses and this he said as if he were playing at ball and what was the ball in that case life chains banishment a draught of poison separation from wife and leaving children orphans these were the things with which he was playing but still he did play and threw the ball skillfully so we should do we must employ all the care of the players but show the same indifference about the ball for we ought by all means to apply our art to some exter
nal material not as valuing the material but whatever it may be showing our art in it thus too the weaver does not make wool but exercises his art upon such as he receives another gives you food and property and is able to take them away and your poor body also when then you have received the material work on it if then you come out of the trial without having suffered anything all who meet you will congratulate you on your escape but he who knows how to look at such things if he shall see that you have behaved properly in the matter will commend you and be pleased with you and if he shall find that you owe your escape to any want of proper behavior he will do the contrary for where rejoicing is reasonable there also is congratulation reasonable  how then is it said that some external things are according to nature and others contrary to nature it is said as it might be said if we were separated from union or society for to the foot i shall say that it is according to nature for it to be clean but if you take
 it as a foot and as a thing not detached independent it will befit it both to step into the mud and tread on thorns and sometimes to be cut off for the good of the whole body otherwise it is no longer a foot we should think in some such way about ourselves also what are you a man if you consider yourself as detached from other men it is according to nature to live to old age to be rich to be healthy but if you consider yourself as a man and a part of a certain whole it is for the sake of that whole that at one time you should be sick at another time take a voyage and run into danger and at another time be in want and in some cases die prematurely why then are you troubled do you not know that as a foot is no longer a foot if it is detached from the body so you are no longer a man if you are separated from other men for what is a man a part of a state of that first which consists of gods and of men then of that which is called next to it which is a small image of the universal state what then must i be brough
t to trial must another have a fever another sail on the sea another die and another be condemned yes for it is impossible in such a body in such a universe of things among so many living together that such things should not happen some to one and others to others it is your duty then since you are come here to say what you ought to arrange these things as it is fit then someone says i shall charge you with doing me wrong much good may it do you i have done my part but whether you also have done yours you must look to that for there is some danger of this too that it may escape your notice  vi of indifference the hypothetical proposition is indifferent the judgment about it is not indifferent but it is either knowledge or opinion or error thus life is indifferent the use is not indifferent when any man then tells you that these things also are indifferent do not become negligent and when a man invites you to be careful about such things do not become abject and struck with admiration of material things and it
 is good for you to know your own preparation and power that in those matters where you have not been prepared you may keep quiet and not be vexed if others have the advantage over you for you too in syllogisms will claim to have the advantage over them and if others should be vexed at this you will console them by saying i have learned them and you have not thus also where there is need of any practice seek not that which is acquired from the need of such practice but yield in that matter to those who have had practice and be yourself content with firmness of mind  go and salute a certain person how not meanly but i have been shut out for i have not learned to make my way through the window and when i have found the door shut i must either come back or enter through the window but still speak to him in what way not meanly but suppose that you have not got what you wanted was this your business and not his why then do you claim that which belongs to another always remember what is your own and what belongs to
 another and you will not be disturbed chrysippus therefore said well so long as future things are uncertain i always cling to those which are more adapted to the conservation of that which is according to nature for god himself has given me the faculty of such choice but if i knew that it was fated in the order of things for me to be sick i would even move towards it for the foot also if it had intelligence would move to go into the mud for why are ears of corn produced is it not that they may become dry and do they not become dry that they may be reaped for they are not separated from communion with other things if then they had perception ought they to wish never to be reaped but this is a curse upon ears of corn to be never reaped so we must know that in the case of men too it is a curse not to die just the same as not to be ripened and not to be reaped but since we must be reaped and we also know that we are reaped we are vexed at it for we neither know what we are nor have we studied what belongs to man
 as those who have studied horses know what belongs to horses but chrysantas when he was going to strike the enemy checked himself when he heard the trumpet sounding a retreat so it seemed better to him to obey the generals command than to follow his own inclination but not one of us chooses even when necessity summons readily to obey it but weeping and groaning we suffer what we do suffer and we call them circumstances what kind of circumstances man if you give the name of circumstances to the things which are around you all things are circumstances but if you call hardships by this name what hardship is there in the dying of that which has been produced but that which destroys is either a sword or a wheel or the sea or a tile or a tyrant why do you care about the way of going down to hades all ways are equal but if you will listen to the truth the way which the tyrant sends you is shorter a tyrant never killed a man in six months but a fever is often a year about it all these things are only sound and the n
oise of empty names  i am in danger of my life from caesar and am not i in danger who dwell in nicopolis where there are so many earthquakes and when you are crossing the adriatic what hazard do you run is it not the hazard of your life but i am in danger also as to opinion do you mean your own how for who can compel you to have any opinion which you do not choose but is it as to another mans opinion and what kind of danger is yours if others have false opinions but i am in danger of being banished what is it to be banished to be somewhere else than at rome yes what then if i should be sent to gyara if that suits you you will go there but if it does not you can go to another place instead of gyara whither he also will go who sends you to gyara whether he choose or not why then do you go up to rome as if it were something great it is not worth all this preparation that an ingenuous youth should say it was not worthwhile to have heard so much and to have written so much and to have sat so long by the side of an
 old man who is not worth much only remember that division by which your own and not your own are distinguished never claim anything which belongs to others a tribunal and a prison are each a place one high and the other low but the will can be maintained equal if you choose to maintain it equal in each and we shall then be imitators of socrates when we are able to write paeans in prison but in our present disposition consider if we could endure in prison another person saying to us would you like me to read paeans to you why do you trouble me do you not know the evils which hold me can i in such circumstances listen to paeans what circumstances i am going to die and will other men be immortal  vii how we ought to use divination through an unreasonable regard to divination many of us omit many duties for what more can the diviner see than death or danger or disease or generally things of that kind if then i must expose myself to danger for a friend and if it is my duty even to die for him what need have i the
n for divination have i not within me a diviner who has told me the nature of good and of evil and has explained to me the signs or marks of both what need have i then to consult the viscera of victims or the flight of birds and why do i submit when he says it is for your interest for does he know what is for my interest does he know what is good and as he has learned the signs of the viscera has he also learned the signs of good and evil for if he knows the signs of these he knows the signs both of the beautiful and of the ugly and of the just and of the unjust do you tell me man what is the thing which is signified for me is it life or death poverty or wealth but whether these things are for my interest or whether they are not i do not intend to ask you why dont you give your opinion on matters of grammar and why do you give it here about things on which we are all in error and disputing with one another the woman therefore who intended to send by a vessel a months provisions to gratilla in her banishment m
ade a good answer to him who said that domitian would seize what she sent i would rather she replied that domitian should seize all than that i should not send it  what then leads us to frequent use of divination cowardice the dread of what will happen this is the reason why we flatter the diviners pray master shall i succeed to the property of my father let us see let us sacrifice on the occasion yes master as fortune chooses when he has said you shall succeed to the inheritance we thank him as if we received the inheritance from him the consequence is that they play upon us  what then should we do we ought to come to divination without desire or aversion as the wayfarer asks of the man whom he meets which of two roads leads to his journeys end without any desire for that which leads to the right rather than to the left for he has no wish to go by any road except the road which leads to his end in the same way ought we to come to god also as a guide as we use our eyes not asking them to show us rather such t
hings as we wish but receiving the appearances of things such as the eyes present them to us but now we trembling take the augur bird interpreter by the hand and while we invoke god we entreat the augur and say master have mercy on me suffer me to come safe out of this difficulty wretch would you have then anything other than what is best is there then anything better than what pleases god why do you as far as is in your power corrupt your judge and lead astray your adviser  viii what is the nature ἡ οὐσία of the good god is beneficial but the good also is beneficial it is consistent then that where the nature of god is there also the nature of the good should be what then is the nature of god flesh certainly not an estate in land by no means fame no is it intelligence knowledge right reason yes herein then simply seek the nature of the good for i suppose that you do not seek it in a plant no do you seek it in an irrational animal no if then you seek it in a rational animal why do you still seek it anywhere e
xcept in the superiority of rational over irrational animals now plants have not even the power of using appearances and for this reason you do not apply the term good to them the good then requires the use of appearances does it require this use only for if you say that it requires this use only say that the good and that happiness and unhappiness are in irrational animals also but you do not say this and you do right for if they possess even in the highest degree the use of appearances yet they have not the faculty of understanding the use of appearances and there is good reason for this for they exist for the purpose of serving others and they exercise no superiority for the ass i suppose does not exist for any superiority over others no but because we had need of a back which is able to bear something and in truth we had need also of his being able to walk and for this reason he received also the faculty of making use of appearances for otherwise he would not have been able to walk and here then the matte
r stopped for if he had also received the faculty of comprehending the use of appearances it is plain that consistently with reason he would not then have been subjected to us nor would he have done us these services but he would have been equal to us and like to us  will you not then seek the nature of good in the rational animal for if it is not there you will not choose to say that it exists in any other thing plant or animal what then are not plants and animals also the works of god they are but they are not superior things nor yet parts of the gods but you are a superior thing you are a portion separated from the deity you have in yourself a certain portion of him why then are you ignorant of your own noble descent why do you not know whence you came will you not remember when you are eating who you are who eat and whom you feed when you are in conjunction with a woman will you not remember who you are who do this thing when you are in social intercourse when you are exercising yourself when you are enga
ged in discussion know you not that you are nourishing a god that you are exercising a god wretch you are carrying about a god with you and you know it not do you think that i mean some god of silver or of gold and external you carry him within yourself and you perceive not that you are polluting him by impure thoughts and dirty deeds and if an image of god were present you would not dare to do any of the things which you are doing but when god himself is present within and sees all and hears all you are not ashamed of thinking such things and doing such things ignorant as you are of your own nature and subject to the anger of god then why do we fear when we are sending a young man from the school into active life lest he should do anything improperly eat improperly have improper intercourse with women and lest the rags in which he is wrapped should debase him lest fine garments should make him proud this youth if he acts thus does not know his own god he knows not with whom he sets out into the world but can
 we endure when he says i wish i had you god with me have you not god with you and do you seek for any other when you have him or will god tell you anything else than this if you were a statue of phidias either athena or zeus you would think both of yourself and of the artist and if you had any understanding power of perception you would try to do nothing unworthy of him who made you or of yourself and try not to appear in an unbecoming dress attitude to those who look on you but now because zeus has made you for this reason do you care not how you shall appear and yet is the artist in the one case like the artist in the other or the work in the one case like the other and what work of an artist for instance has in itself the faculties which the artist shows in making it is it not marble or bronze or gold or ivory and the athena of phidias when she has once extended the hand and received in it the figure of victory stands in that attitude forever but the works of god have power of motion they breathe they hav
e the faculty of using the appearances of things and the power of examining them being the work of such an artist do you dishonor him and what shall i say not only that he made you but also entrusted you to yourself and made you a deposit to yourself will you not think of this too but do you also dishonor your guardianship but if god had entrusted an orphan to you would you thus neglect him he has delivered yourself to your own care and says i had no one fitter to entrust him to than yourself keep him for me such as he is by nature modest faithful erect unterrifled free from passion and perturbation and then you do not keep him such but some will say whence has this fellow got the arrogance which he displays and these supercilious looksi have not yet so much gravity as befits a philosopher for i do not yet feel confidence in what i have learned and in what i have assented to i still fear my own weakness let me get confidence and then you shall see a countenance such as i ought to have and an attitude such as 
i ought to have then i will show to you the statue when it is perfected when it is polished what do you expect a supercilious countenance does the zeus at olympia lift up his brow no his look is fixed as becomes him who is ready to say  irrevocable is my word and shall not fail iliad i  such will i show myself to you faithful modest noble free from perturbationwhat and immortal too exempt from old age and from sickness no but dying as becomes a god sickening as becomes a god this power i possess this i can do but the rest i do not possess nor can i do i will show the nerves strength of a philosopher what nerves are these a desire never disappointed an aversion which never falls on that which it would avoid a proper pursuit ὁρμήν a diligent purpose an assent which is not rash these you shall see  ix that when we cannot fulfil that which the character of a man promises we assume the character of a philosopher it is no common easy thing to do this only to fulfil the promise of a mans nature for what is a man the
 answer is a rational and mortal being then by the rational faculty from whom are we separated from wild beasts and from what others from sheep and like animals take care then to do nothing like a wild beastbut if you do you have lost the character of a man you have not fulfilled your promise see that you do nothing like a sheepbut if you do in this case also the man is lost what then do we do as sheep when we act gluttonously when we act lewdly when we act rashly filthily inconsiderately to what have we declined to sheep what have we lost the rational faculty when we act contentiously and harmfully and passionately and violently to what have we declined to wild beasts consequently some of us are great wild beasts and others little beasts of a bad disposition and small whence we may say let me be eaten by a lion but in all these ways the promise of a man acting as a man is destroyed for when is a conjunctive complex proposition maintained when it fulfils what its nature promises so that the preservation of a 
complex proposition is when it is a conjunction of truths when is a disjunctive maintained when it fulfils what it promises when are flutes a lyre a horse a dog preserved when they severally keep their promise what is the wonder then if man also in like manner is preserved and in like manner is lost each man is improved and preserved by corresponding acts the carpenter by acts of carpentry the grammarian by acts of grammar but if a man accustoms himself to write ungrammatically of necessity his art will be corrupted and destroyed thus modest actions preserve the modest man and immodest actions destroy him and actions of fidelity preserve the faithful man and the contrary actions destroy him and on the other hand contrary actions strengthen contrary characters shamelessness strengthens the shameless man faithlessness the faithless man abusive words the abusive man anger the man of an angry temper and unequal receiving and giving make the avaricious man more avaricious  for this reason philosophers admonish us 
not to be satisfied with learning only but also to add study and then practice for we have long been accustomed to do contrary things and we put in practice opinions which are contrary to true opinions if then we shall not also put in practice right opinions we shall be nothing more than the expositors of the opinions of others for now who among us is not able to discourse according to the rules of art about good and evil things in this fashion that of things some are good and some are bad and some are indifferent the good then are virtues and the things which participate in virtues and the bad are the contrary and the indifferent are wealth health reputationthen if in the midst of our talk there should happen some greater noise than usual or some of those who are present should laugh at us we are disturbed philosopher where are the things which you were talking about whence did you produce and utter them from the lips and thence only why then do you corrupt the aids provided by others why do you treat the we
ightiest matters as if you were playing a game of dice for it is one thing to lay up bread and wine as in a storehouse and another thing to eat that which has been eaten is digested distributed and is become sinews flesh bones blood healthy color healthy breath whatever is stored up when you choose you can readily take and show it but you have no other advantage from it except so far as to appear to possess it for what is the difference between explaining these doctrines and those of men who have different opinions sit down now and explain according to the rules of art the opinions of epicurus and perhaps you will explain his opinions in a more useful manner than epicurus himself why then do you call yourself a stoic why do you deceive the many why do you act the part of a jew when you are a greek do you not see how why each is called a jew or a syrian or an egyptian and when we see a man inclining to two sides we are accustomed to say this man is not a jew but he acts as one but when he has assumed the affec
ts of one who has been imbued with jewish doctrine and has adopted that sect then he is in fact and he is named a jew thus we too being falsely imbued baptized are in name jews but in fact we are something else our affects feelings are inconsistent with our words we are far from practicing what we say and that of which we are proud as if we knew it thus being unable to fulfil even what the character of a man promises we even add to it the profession of a philosopher which is as heavy a burden as if a man who is unable to bear ten pounds should attempt to raise the stone which ajax lifted  x how we may discover the duties of life from names consider who you are in the first place you are a man and this is one who has nothing superior to the faculty of the will but all other things subjected to it and the faculty itself he possesses unenslaved and free from subjection consider then from what things you have been separated by reason you have been separated from wild beasts you have been separated from domestic a
nimals προβάτων further you are a citizen of the world and a part of it not one of the subservient serving but one of the principal ruling parts for you are capable of comprehending the divine administration and of considering the connection of things what then does the character of a citizen promise profess to hold nothing as profitable to himself to deliberate about nothing as if he were detached from the community but to act as the hand or foot would do if they had reason and understood the constitution of nature for they would never put themselves in motion nor desire anything otherwise than with reference to the whole therefore the philosophers say well that if the good man had foreknowledge of what would happen he would cooperate towards his own sickness and death and mutilation since he knows that these things are assigned to him according to the universal arrangement and that the whole is superior to the part and the state to the citizen but now because we do not know the future it is our duty to stic
k to the things which are in their nature more suitable for our choice for we were made among other things for this  after this remember that you are a son what does this character promise to consider that everything which is the sons belongs to the father to obey him in all things never to blame him to another nor to say or do anything which does him injury to yield to him in all things and give way cooperating with him as far as you can after this know that you are a brother also and that to this character it is due to make concessions to be easily persuaded to speak good of your brother never to claim in opposition to him any of the things which are independent of the will but readily to give them up that you may have the larger share in what is dependent on the will for see what a thing it is in place of a lettuce if it should so happen or a seat to gain for yourself goodness of disposition how great is the advantage  next to this if you are a senator of any state remember that you are a senator if a yout
h that you are a youth if an old man that you are an old man for each of such names if it comes to be examined marks out the proper duties but if you go and blame your brother i say to you you have forgotten who you are and what is your name in the next place if you were a smith and made a wrong use of the hammer you would have forgotten the smith and if you have forgotten the brother and instead of a brother have become an enemy would you appear not to have changed one thing for another in that case and if instead of a man who is a tame animal and social you are become a mischievous wild beast treacherous and biting have you lost nothing but i suppose you must lose a bit of money that you may suffer damage and does the loss of nothing else do a man damage if you had lost the art of grammar or music would you think the loss of it a damage and if you shall lose modesty moderation καταστολήν and gentleness do you think the loss nothing and yet the things first mentioned are lost by some cause external and indep
endent of the will and the second by our own fault and as to the first neither to have them nor to lose them is shameful but as to the second not to have them and to lose them is shameful and matter of reproach and a misfortune what does the pathic lose he loses the character of man what does he lose who makes the pathic what he is many other things and he also loses the man no less than the other what does he lose who commits adultery he loses the character of the modest the temperate the decent the citizen the neighbour what does he lose who is angry something else what does the coward lose something else no man is bad without suffering some loss and damage if then you look for the damage in the loss of money only all these men receive no harm or damage it may be they have even profit and gain when they acquire a bit of money by any of these deeds but consider that if you refer everything to a small coin not even he who loses his nose is in your opinion damaged yes you say for he is mutilated in his body we
ll but does he who has lost his smell only lose nothing is there then no energy of the soul which is an advantage to him who possesses it and a damage to him who has lost it tell me what sort of energy you mean have we not a natural modesty we have does he who loses this sustain no damage is he deprived of nothing does he part with nothing of the things which belong to him have we not naturally fidelity natural affection a natural disposition to help others a natural disposition to forbearance the man then who allows himself to be damaged in these matters can he be free from harm and uninjured what then shall i not hurt him who has hurt me in the first place consider what hurt βλάβη is and remember what you have heard from the philosophers for if the good consists in the will purpose intention προαιρέσει and the evil also in the will see if what you say is not this what then since that man has hurt himself by doing an unjust act to me shall i not hurt myself by doing some unjust act to him why do we not imagi
ne to ourselves mentally think of something of this kind but where there is any detriment to the body or to our possession there is harm there and where the same thing happens to the faculty of the will there is you suppose no harm for he who has been deceived or he who has done an unjust act neither suffers in the head nor in the eye nor in the hip nor does he lose his estate and we wish for nothing else than security to these things but whether we shall have the will modest and faithful or shameless and faithless we care not the least except only in the school so far as a few words are concerned therefore our proficiency is limited to these few words but beyond them it does not exist even in the slightest degree  xi what the beginning of philosophy is the beginning of philosophy to him at least who enters on it in the right way and by the door is a consciousness of his own weakness and inability about necessary things for we come into the world with no natural notion of a rightangled triangle or of a diesis
 a quarter tone or of a half tone but we learn each of these things by a certain transmission according to art and for this reason those who do not know them do not think that they know them but as to good and evil and beautiful and ugly and becoming and unbecoming and happiness and misfortune and proper and improper and what we ought to do and what we ought not to do who ever came into the world without having an innate idea of them wherefore we all use these names and we endeavor to fit the preconceptions to the several cases things thus he has done well he has not done well he has done as he ought not as he ought he has been unfortunate he has been fortunate he is unjust he is just who does not use these names who among us defers the use of them till he has learned them as he defers the use of the words about lines geometrical figures or sounds and the cause of this is that we come into the world already taught as it were by nature some things on this matter τόπον and proceeding from these we have added to
 them selfconceit οἴησιν for why a man says do i not know the beautiful and the ugly have i not the notion of it you have do i not adapt it to particulars you do do i not then adapt it properly in that lies the whole question and conceit is added here for beginning from these things which are admitted men proceed to that which is matter of dispute by means of unsuitable adaptation for if they possessed this power of adaptation in addition to those things what would hinder them from being perfect but now since you think that you properly adapt the preconceptions to the particulars tell me whence you derive this assume that you do so because i think so but it does not seem so to another and he thinks that he also makes a proper adaptation or does he not think so he does think so is it possible then that both of you can properly apply the preconceptions to things about which you have contrary opinions it is not possible can you then show us anything better towards adapting the preconceptions beyond your thinking
 that you do does the madman do any other things than the things which seem to him right is then this criterion sufficient for him also it is not sufficient come then to something which is superior to seeming τοῦ δοκεῖν what is this  observe this is the beginning of philosophy a perception of the disagreement of men with one another and an inquiry into the cause of the disagreement and a condemnation and distrust of that which only seems and a certain investigation of that which seems whether it seems rightly and a discovery of some rule κανόνος as we have discovered a balance in the determination of weights and a carpenters rule or square in the case of straight and crooked thingsthis is the beginning of philosophy must we say that all things are right which seem so to all and how is it possible that contradictions can be rightnot all then but all which seem to us to be righthow more to you than those which seem right to the syrians why more than what seem right to the egyptians why more than what seems righ
t to me or to any other man not at all more what then seems to every man is not sufficient for determining what is for neither in the case of weights or measures are we satisfied with the bare appearance but in each case we have discovered a certain rule in this matter then is there no rule superior to what seems and how is it possible that the most necessary things among men should have no sign mark and be incapable of being discovered there is then some rule and why then do we not seek the rule and discover it and afterwards use it without varying from it not even stretching out the finger without it for this i think is that which when it is discovered cures of their madness those who use mere seeming as a measure and misuse it so that for the future proceeding from certain things principles known and made clear we may use in the case of particular things the preconceptions which are distinctly fixed  what is the matter presented to us about which we are inquiring pleasure for example subject it to the rule
 throw it into the balance ought the good to be such a thing that it is fit that we have confidence in it yes and in which we ought to confide it ought to be is it fit to trust to anything which is insecure no is then pleasure anything secure no take it then and throw it out of the scale and drive it far away from the place of good things but if you are not sharpsighted and one balance is not enough for you bring another is it fit to be elated over what is good yes is it proper then to be elated over present pleasure see that you do not say that it is proper but if you do i shall then not think you worthy even of the balance thus things are tested and weighed when the rules are ready and to philosophize is this to examine and confirm the rules and then to use them when they are known is the act of a wise and good man  xii of disputation or discussion what things a man must learn in order to be able to apply the art of disputation has been accurately shown by our philosophers the stoics but with respect to the
 proper use of the things we are entirely without practice only give to any of us whom you please an illiterate man to discuss with and he cannot discover how to deal with the man but when he has moved the man a little if he answers beside the purpose he does not know how to treat him but he then either abuses or ridicules him and says he is an illiterate man it is not possible to do anything with him now a guide when he has found a man out of the road leads him into the right way he does not ridicule or abuse him and then leave him do you also show the illiterate man the truth and you will see that he follows but so long as you do not show him the truth do not ridicule him but rather feel your own incapacity  how then did socrates act he used to compel his adversary in disputation to bear testimony to him and he wanted no other witness therefore he could say i care not for other witnesses but i am always satisfied with the evidence testimony of my adversary and i do not ask the opinion of others but only the
 opinion of him who is disputing with me for he used to make the conclusions drawn from natural notions so plain that every man saw the contradiction if it existed and withdrew from it thus does the envious man rejoice by no means but he is rather pained well do you think that envy is pain over evils and what envy is there of evils therefore he made his adversary say that envy is pain over good things well then would any man envy those who are nothing to him by no means thus having completed the notion and distinctly fixed it he would go away without saying to his adversary define to me envy and if the adversary had defined envy he did not say you have defined it badly for the terms of the definition do not correspond to the thing definedthese are technical terms and for this reason disagreeable and hardly intelligible to illiterate men which terms we philosophers cannot lay aside but that the illiterate man himself who follows the appearances presented to him should be able to concede anything or reject it w
e can never by the use of these terms move him to do accordingly being conscious of our own inability we do not attempt the thing at least such of us as have any caution do not but the greater part and the rash when they enter into such disputations confuse themselves and confuse others and finally abusing their adversaries and abused by them they walk away now this was the first and chief peculiarity of socrates never to be irritated in argument never to utter anything abusive anything insulting but to bear with abusive persons and to put an end to the quarrel if you would know what great power he had in this way read the symposium of xenophon and you will see how many quarrels he put an end to hence with good reason in the poets also this power is most highly praised  quickly with skill he settles great disputes hesiod theogony v  well then the matter is not now very safe and particularly at rome for he who attempts to do it must not do it in a corner you may be sure but must go to a man of consular rank if
 it so happen or to a rich man and ask him can you tell me sir to whose care you have entrusted your horses i can tell you have you entrusted them to any person indifferently and to one who has no experience of horses by no means well then can you tell me to whom you entrust your gold or silver things or your vestments i dont entrust even these to anyone indifferently well your own body have you already considered about entrusting the care of it to any person certainly to a man of experience i suppose and one acquainted with the aliptic or with the healing art without doubt are these the best things that you have or do you also possess something else which is better than all these what kind of a thing do you mean that i mean which makes use of these things and tests each of them and deliberates is it the soul that you mean you think right for it is the soul that i mean in truth i do think that the soul is a much better thing than all the others which i possess can you then show us in what way you have taken c
are of the soul for it is not likely that you who are so wise a man and have a reputation in the city inconsiderately and carelessly allow the most valuable thing that you possess to be neglected and to perish certainly not but have you taken care of the soul yourself and have you learned from another to do this or have you discovered the means yourself here comes the danger that in the first place he may say what is this to you my good man who are you next if you persist in troubling him there is danger that he may raise his hands and give you blows i was once myself also an admirer of this mode of instruction until i fell into these dangers  xiii on anxiety solicitude when i see a man anxious i say what does this man want if he did not want something which is not in his power how could he be anxious for this reason a lute player when he is singing by himself has no anxiety but when he enters the theatre he is anxious even if he has a good voice and plays well on the lute for he not only wishes to sing well 
but also to obtain applause but this is not in his power accordingly where he has skill there he has confidence bring any single person who knows nothing of music and the musician does not care for him but in the matter where a man knows nothing and has not been practiced there he is anxious what matter is this he knows not what a crowd is or what the praise of a crowd is however he has learned to strike the lowest chord and the highest but what the praise of the many is and what power it has in life he neither knows nor has he thought about it hence he must of necessity tremble and grow pale i cannot then say that a man is not a lute player when i see him afraid but i can say something else and not one thing but many and first of all i call him a stranger and say this man does not know in what part of the world he is but though he has been here so long he is ignorant of the laws of the state and the customs and what is permitted and what is not and he has never employed any lawyer to tell him and to explain 
the laws but a man does not write a will if he does not know how it ought to be written or he employs a person who does know nor does he rashly seal a bond or write a security but he uses his desire without a lawyers advice and aversion and pursuit movement and attempt and purpose how do you mean without a lawyer he does not know that he wills what is not allowed and does not will that which is of necessity and he does not know either what is his own or what is another mans but if he did know he would never be impeded he would never be hindered he would not be anxious how so is any man then afraid about things which are not evilsnois he afraid about things which are evils but still so far within his power that they may not happencertainly he is notif then the things which are independent of the will are neither good nor bad and all things which do depend on the will are within our power and no man can either take them from us or give them to us if we do not choose where is room left for anxiety but we are anx
ious about our poor body our little property about the will of caesar but not anxious about things internal are we anxious about not forming a false opinionno for this is in my powerabout not exerting our movements contrary to natureno not even about thiswhen then you see a man pale as the physician says judging from the complexion this mans spleen is disordered that mans liver so also say this mans desire and aversion are disordered he is not in the right way he is in a fever for nothing else changes the color or causes trembling or chattering of the teeth or causes a man to  sink in his knees and shift from foot to foot iliad xiii  for this reason when zeno was going to meet antigonus he was not anxious for antigonus had no power over any of the things which zeno admired and zeno did not care for those things over which antigonus had power but antigonus was anxious when he was going to meet zeno for he wished to please zeno but this was a thing external out of his power but zeno did not want to please antig
onus for no man who is skilled in any art wishes to please one who has no such skill  should i try to please you why i suppose you know the measure by which one man is estimated by another have you taken pains to learn what is a good man and what is a bad man and how a man becomes one or the other why then are you not good yourself how he replies am i not good because no good man laments or groans or weeps no good man is pale and trembles or says how will he receive me how will he listen to me slave just as it pleases him why do you care about what belongs to others is it now his fault if he receives badly what proceeds from you certainly and is it possible that a fault should be one mans and the evil in another no why then are you anxious about that which belongs to others your question is reasonable but i am anxious how i shall speak to him cannot you then speak to him as you choose but i fear that i may be disconcerted if you are going to write the name of dion are you afraid that you would be disconcerted
 by no means why is it not because you have practiced writing the name certainly well if you were going to read the name would you not feel the same and why because every art has a certain strength and confidence in the things which belong to ithave you then not practiced speaking and what else did you learn in the school syllogisms and sophistical propositions for what purpose was it not for the purpose of discoursing skillfully and is not discoursing skillfully the same as discoursing seasonably and cautiously and with intelligence and also without making mistakes and without hindrance and besides all this with confidence yes when then you are mounted on a horse and go into a plain are you anxious at being matched against a man who is on foot and anxious in a matter in which you are practiced and he is not yes but that person to whom i am going to speak has power to kill me speak the truth then unhappy man and do not brag nor claim to be a philosopher nor refuse to acknowledge your masters but so long as yo
u present this handle in your body follow every man who is stronger than yourself socrates used to practice speaking he who talked as he did to the tyrants to the dicasts judges he who talked in his prison diogenes had practiced speaking he who spoke as he did to alexander to the pirates to the person who bought him these men were confident in the things which they practiced but do you walk off to your own affairs and never leave them go and sit in a corner and weave syllogisms and propose them to another there is not in you the man who can rule a state  xiv to naso when a certain roman entered with his son and listened to one reading epictetus said this is the method of instruction and he stopped when the roman asked him to go on epictetus said every art when it is taught causes labor to him who is unacquainted with it and is unskilled in it and indeed the things which proceed from the arts immediately show their use in the purpose for which they were made and most of them contain something attractive and pl
easing for indeed to be present and to observe how a shoemaker learns is not a pleasant thing but the shoe is useful and also not disagreeable to look at and the discipline of a smith when he is learning is very disagreeable to one who chances to be present and is a stranger to the art but the work shows the use of the art but you will see this much more in music for if you are present while a person is learning the discipline will appear most disagreeable and yet the results of music are pleasing and delightful to those who know nothing of music and here we conceive the work of a philosopher to be something of this kind he must adapt his wish βούλησιν to what is going on so that neither any of the things which are taking place shall take place contrary to our wish nor any of the things which do not take place shall not take place when we wish that they should from this the result is to those who have so arranged the work of philosophy not to fail in the desire nor to fall in with that which they would avoid 
without uneasiness without fear without perturbation to pass through life themselves together with their associates maintaining the relations both natural and acquired as the relation of son of father of brother of citizen of man of wife of neighbour of fellow traveller of ruler of ruled the work of a philosopher we conceive to be something like this it remains next to inquire how this must be accomplished  we see then that the carpenter τέκτων when he has learned certain things becomes a carpenter the pilot by learning certain things becomes a pilot may it not then in philosophy also not be sufficient to wish to be wise and good and that there is also a necessity to learn certain things we inquire then what these things are the philosophers say that we ought first to learn that there is a god and that he provides for all things also that it is not possible to conceal from him our acts or even our intentions and thoughts the next thing is to learn what is the nature of the gods for such as they are discovered
 to be he who would please and obey them must try with all his power to be like them if the divine is faithful man also must be faithful if it is free man also must be free if beneficent man also must be beneficent if magnanimous man also must be magnanimous as being then an imitator of god he must do and say everything consistently with this fact  with what then must we begin if you will enter on the discussion i will tell you that you must first understand names words so then you say that i do not now understand names you do not understand them how then do i use them just as the illiterate use written language as cattle use appearances for use is one thing understanding is another but if you think that you understand them produce whatever word you please and let us try whether we understand it but it is a disagreeable thing for a man to be confuted who is now old and it may be has now served his three campaigns i too know this for now you are come to me as if you were in want of nothing and what could you e
ven imagine to be wanting to you you are rich you have children and a wife perhaps and many slaves caesar knows you in rome you have many friends you render their dues to all you know how to requite him who does you a favor and to repay in the same kind him who does you a wrong what do you lack if then i shall show you that you lack the things most necessary and the chief things for happiness and that hitherto you have looked after everything rather than what you ought and to crown all that you neither know what god is nor what man is nor what is good nor what is bad and as to what i have said about your ignorance of other matters that may perhaps be endured but if i say that you know nothing about yourself how is it possible that you should endure me and bear the proof and stay here it is not possible but you immediately go off in bad humor and yet what harm have i done you unless the mirror also injures the ugly man because it shows him to himself such as he is unless the physician also is supposed to insul
t the sick man when he says to him man do you think that you ail nothing but you have a fever go without food today drink water and no one says what an insult but if you say to a man your desires are inflamed your aversions are low your intentions are inconsistent your pursuits movements are not conformable to nature your opinions are rash and false the man immediately goes away and says he has insulted me  our way of dealing is like that of a crowded assembly beasts are brought to be sold and oxen and the greater part of the men come to buy and sell and there are some few who come to look at the market and to inquire how it is carried on and why and who fixes the meeting and for what purpose so it is here also in this assembly of life some like cattle trouble themselves about nothing except their fodder for to all of you who are busy about possessions and lands and slaves and magisterial offices these are nothing except fodder but there are a few who attend the assembly men who love to look on and consider w
hat is the world who governs it has it no governor and how is it possible that a city or a family cannot continue to exist not even the shortest time without an administrator and guardian and that so great and beautiful a system should be administered with such order and yet without a purpose and by chance there is then an administrator what kind of administrator and how does he govern and who are we who were produced by him and for what purpose have we some connection with him and some relation towards him or none this is the way in which these few are affected and then they apply themselves only to this one thing to examine the meeting and then to go away what then they are ridiculed by the many as the spectators at the fair are by the traders and if the beasts had any understanding they would ridicule those who admired anything else than fodder  xv to or against those who obstinately persist in what they have determined when some persons have heard these words that a man ought to be constant firm and that 
the will is naturally free and not subject to compulsion but that all other things are subject to hindrance to slavery and are in the power of others they suppose that they ought without deviation to abide by everything which they have determined but in the first place that which has been determined ought to be sound true i require tone sinews in the body but such as exists in a healthy body in an athletic body but if it is plain to me that you have the tone of a frenzied man and you boast of it i shall say to you man seek the physician this is not tone but atony deficiency in right tone in a different way something of the same kind is felt by those who listen to these discourses in a wrong manner which was the case with one of my companions who for no reason resolved to starve himself to death i heard of it when it was the third day of his abstinence from food and i went to inquire what had happened i have resolved he saidbut still tell me what it was which induced you to resolve for if you have resolved rig
htly we shall sit with you and assist you to depart but if you have made an unreasonable resolution change your mind we ought to keep to our determinations what are you doing man we ought to keep not to all our determinations but to those which are right for if you are now persuaded that it is night do not change your mind if you think fit but persist and say we ought to abide by our determinations will you not make the beginning and lay the foundation in an inquiry whether the determination is sound or not sound and so then build on it firmness and security but if you lay a rotten and ruinous foundation will not your miserable little building fall down the sooner the more and the stronger are the materials which you shall lay on it without any reason would you withdraw from us out of life a man who is a friend and a companion a citizen of the same city both the great and the small city then while you are committing murder and destroying a man who has done no wrong do you say that you ought to abide by your d
eterminations and if it ever in any way came into your head to kill me ought you to abide by your determinations  now this man was with difficulty persuaded to change his mind but it is impossible to convince some persons at present so that i seem now to know what i did not know before the meaning of the common saying that you can neither persuade nor break a fool may it never be my lot to have a wise fool for my friend nothing is more untractable i am determined the man says madmen are also but the more firmly they form a judgment on things which do not exist the more hellebore they require will you not act like a sick man and call in the physiciani am sick master help me consider what i must do it is my duty to obey you so it is here also i know not what i ought to do but i am come to learn not so but speak to me about other things upon this i have determined what other things for what is greater and more useful than for you to be persuaded that it is not sufficient to have made your determination and not t
o change it this is the tone energy of madness not of health i will die if you compel me to this why man what has happened i have determined i have had a lucky escape that you have not determined to kill me i take no money why i have determined be assured that with the very tone energy which you now use in refusing to take there is nothing to hinder you at some time from inclining without reason to take money and then saying i have determined as in a distempered body subject to defluxions the humor inclines sometimes to these parts and then to those so too a sickly soul knows not which way to incline but if to this inclination and movement there is added a tone obstinate resolution then the evil becomes past help and cure  xvi that we do not strive to use our opinions about good and evil where is the good in the will where is the evil in the will where is neither of them in those things which are independent of the will well then does anyone among us think of these lessons out of the schools does anyone medit
ate strive by himself to give an answer to things as in the case of questions is it dayyesis it nightnowell is the number of stars eveni cannot saywhen money is shown offered to you have you studied to make the proper answer that money is not a good thing have you practiced yourself in these answers or only against sophisms why do you wonder then if in the cases which you have studied in those you have improved but in those which you have not studied in those you remain the same when the rhetorician knows that he has written well that he has committed to memory what he has written and brings an agreeable voice why is he still anxious because he is not satisfied with having studied what then does he want to be praised by the audience for the purpose then of being able to practice declamation he has been disciplined but with respect to praise and blame he has not been disciplined for when did he hear from anyone what praise is what blame is what the nature of each is what kind of praise should be sought or what
 kind of blame should be shunned and when did he practice this discipline which follows these words things why then do you still wonder if in the matters which a man has learned there he surpasses others and in those in which he has not been disciplined there he is the same with the many so the lute player knows how to play sings well and has a fine dress and yet he trembles when he enters on the stage for these matters he understands but he does not know what a crowd is nor the shouts of a crowd nor what ridicule is neither does he know what anxiety is whether it is our work or the work of another whether it is possible to stop it or not for this reason if he has been praised he leaves the theatre puffed up but if he has been ridiculed the swollen bladder has been punctured and subsides  this is the case also with ourselves what do we admire externals about what things are we busy externals and have we any doubt then why we fear or why we are anxious what then happens when we think the things which are comin
g on us to be evils it is not in our power not to be afraid it is not in our power not to be anxious then we say lord god how shall i not be anxious fool have you not hands did not god make them for you sit down now and pray that your nose may not run wipe yourself rather and do not blame him well then has he given to you nothing in the present case has he not given to you endurance has he not given to you magnanimity has he not given to you manliness when you have such hands do you still look for one who shall wipe your nose but we neither study these things nor care for them give me a man who cares how he shall do anything not for the obtaining of a thing but who cares about his own energy what man when he is walking about cares for his own energy who when he is deliberating cares about his own deliberation and not about obtaining that about which he deliberates and if he succeeds he is elated and says how well we have deliberated did i not tell you brother that it is impossible when we have thought about a
nything that it should not turn out thus but if the thing should turn out otherwise the wretched man is humbled he knows not even what to say about what has taken place who among us for the sake of this matter has consulted a seer who among us as to his actions has not slept in indifference who give name to me one that i may see the man whom i have long been looking for who is truly noble and ingenuous whether young or old name him  why then are we still surprised if we are well practiced in thinking about matters any given subject but in our acts are low without decency worthless cowardly impatient of labor altogether bad for we do not care about these things nor do we study them but if we had feared not death or banishment but fear itself we should have studied not to fall into those things which appear to us evils now in the school we are irritable and wordy and if any little question arises about any of these things we are able to examine them fully but drag us to practice and you will find us miserably s
hipwrecked let some disturbing appearance come on us and you will know what we have been studying and in what we have been exercising ourselves consequently through want of discipline we are always adding something to the appearance and representing things to be greater than what they are for instance as to myself when i am on a voyage and look down on the deep sea or look round on it and see no land i am out of my mind and imagine that i must drink up all this water if i am wrecked and it does not occur to me that three pints are enough what then disturbs me the sea no but my opinion again when an earthquake shall happen i imagine that the city is going to fall on me but is not one little stone enough to knock my brains out  what then are the things which are heavy on us and disturb us what else than opinions what else than opinions lies heavy upon him who goes away and leaves his companions and friends and places and habits of life now little children for instance when they cry on the nurse leaving them for
 a short time forget their sorrow if they receive a small cake do you choose then that we should compare you to little childrenno by zeus for i do not wish to be pacified by a small cake but by right opinionsand what are these such as a man ought to study all day and not to be affected by anything that is not his own neither by companion nor place nor gymnasia and not even by his own body but to remember the law and to have it before his eyes and what is the divine law to keep a mans own not to claim that which belongs to others but to use what is given and when it is not given not to desire it and when a thing is taken away to give it up readily and immediately and to be thankful for the time that a man has had the use of it if you would not cry for your nurse and mamma for what matter does it make by what thing a man is subdued and on what he depends in what respect are you better than he who cries for a girl if you grieve for a little gymnasium and little porticoes and young men and such places of amusemen
t another comes and laments that he shall no longer drink the water of dirce is the marcian water worse than that of dirce but i was used to the water of dirce and you in turn will be used to the other then if you become attached to this also cry for this too and try to make a verse like the verse of euripides  the hot baths of nero and the marcian water see how tragedy is made when common things happen to silly men  when then shall i see athens again and the acropolis wretch are you not content with what you see daily have you anything better or greater to see than the sun the moon the stars the whole earth the sea but if indeed you comprehend him who administers the whole and carry him about in yourself do you still desire small stones and a beautiful rock when then you are going to leave the sun itself and the moon what will you do will you sit and weep like children well what have you been doing in the school what did you hear what did you learn why did you write yourself a philosopher when you might have
 written the truth as i made certain introductions and i read chrysippus but i did not even approach the door of a philosopher for how should i possess anything of the kind which socrates possessed who died as he did who lived as he did or anything such as diogenes possessed do you think that any one of such men wept or grieved because he was not going to see a certain man or a certain woman nor to be in athens or in corinth but if it should so happen in susa or in ecbatana for if a man can quit the banquet when he chooses and no longer amuse himself does he still stay and complain and does he not stay as at any amusement only so long as he is pleased such a man i suppose would endure perpetual exile or to be condemned to death will you not be weaned now like children and take more solid food and not cry after mammas and nurses which are the lamentations of old women but if i go away i shall cause them sorrow you cause them sorrow by no means but that will cause them sorrow which also causes you sorrow opinio
n what have you to do then take away your own opinion and if these women are wise they will take away their own if they do not they will lament through their own fault  my man as the proverb says make a desperate effort on behalf of tranquillity of mind freedom and magnanimity lift up your head at last as released from slavery dare to look up to god and say deal with me for the future as thou wilt i am of the same mind as thou art i am thine i refuse nothing that pleases thee lead me where thou wilt clothe me in any dress thou choosest is it thy will that i should hold the office of a magistrate that i should be in the condition of a private man stay here or be an exile be poor be rich i will make thy defense to men in behalf of all these conditions i will show the nature of each thing what it is you will not do so but sit in an oxs belly and wait for your mamma till she shall feed you who would hercules have been if he had sat at home he would have been eurystheus and not hercules well and in his travels thr
ough the world how many intimates and how many friends had he but nothing more dear to him than god for this reason it was believed that he was the son of god and he was in obedience to god then he went about purging away injustice and lawlessness but you are not hercules and you are not able to purge away the wickedness of others nor yet are you theseus able to purge away the evil things of attica clear away your own from yourself from your thoughts cast away instead of procrustes and sciron sadness fear desire envy malevolence avarice effeminacy intemperance but it is not possible to eject these things otherwise than by looking to god only by fixing your affections on him only by being consecrated to his commands but if you choose anything else you will with sighs and groans be compelled to follow what is stronger than yourself always seeking tranquillity and never able to find it for you seek tranquillity there where it is not and you neglect to seek it where it is  xvii how we must adapt preconceptions to
 particular cases what is the first business of him who philosophizes to throw away selfconceit οἴησις for it is impossible for a man to begin to learn that which he thinks that he knows as to things then which ought to be done and ought not to be done and good and bad and beautiful and ugly all of us talking of them at random go to the philosophers and on these matters we praise we censure we accuse we blame we judge and determine about principles honorable and dishonorable but why do we go to the philosophers because we wish to learn what we do not think that we know and what is this theorems for we wish to learn what philosophers say as being something elegant and acute and some wish to learn that they may get profit from what they learn it is ridiculous then to think that a person wishes to learn one thing and will learn another or further that a man will make proficiency in that which he does not learn but the many are deceived by this which deceived also the rhetorician theopompus when he blames even pl
ato for wishing everything to be defined for what does he say did none of us before you use the words good or just or do we utter the sounds in an unmeaning and empty way without understanding what they severally signify now who tells you theopompus that we had not natural notions of each of these things and preconceptions προλήψεις but it is not possible to adapt preconceptions to their correspondent objects if we have not distinguished analyzed them and inquired what object must be subjected to each preconception you may make the same charge against physicians also for who among us did not use the words healthy and unhealthy before hippocrates lived or did we utter these words as empty sounds for we have also a certain preconception of health but we are not able to adapt it for this reason one says abstain from food another says give food another says bleed and another says use cupping what is the reason is it any other than that a man cannot properly adapt the preconception of health to particulars  so it 
is in this matter also in the things which concern life who among us does not speak of good and bad of useful and not useful for who among us has not a preconception of each of these things is it then a distinct and perfect preconception show this how shall i show this adapt the preconception properly to the particular things plato for instance subjects definitions to the preconception of the useful but you to the preconception of the useless is it possible then that both of you are right how is it possible does not one man adapt the preconception of good to the matter of wealth and another not to wealth but to the matter of pleasure and to that of health for generally if all of us who use those words know sufficiently each of them and need no diligence in resolving making distinct the notions of the preconceptions why do we differ why do we quarrel why do we blame one another  and why do i now allege this contention with one another and speak of it if you yourself properly adapt your preconceptions why are y
ou unhappy why are you hindered let us omit at present the second topic about the pursuits ὅρμας and the study of the duties which relate to them let us omit also the third topic which relates to the assents συγκαταθέσεις i give up to you these two topics let us insist upon the first which presents an almost obvious demonstration that we do not properly adapt the preconceptions do you now desire that which is possible and that which is possible to you why then are you hindered why are you unhappy do you not now try to avoid the unavoidable why then do you fall in with anything which you would avoid why are you unfortunate why when you desire a thing does it not happen and when you do not desire it does it happen for this is the greatest proof of unhappiness and misery i wish for something and it does not happen and what is more wretched than i  it was because she could not endure this that medea came to murder her children an act of a noble spirit in this view at least for she had a just opinion what it is fo
r a thing not to succeed which a person wishes then she says thus i shall be avenged on him my husband who has wronged and insulted me and what shall i gain if he is punished thus how then shall it be done i shall kill my children but i shall punish myself also and what do i care this is the aberration of soul which possesses great energy for she did not know wherein lies the doing of that which we wish that you cannot get this from without nor yet by the alteration and new adaptation of things do not desire the man jason medeas husband and nothing which you desire will fail to happen do not obstinately desire that he shall live with you do not desire to remain in gerinth and in a word desire nothing than that which god willsand who shall hinder you who shall compel you no man shall compel you any more than he shall compel zeus  when you have such a guide and your wishes and desires are the same as his why do you still fear disappointment give up your desire to wealth and your aversion to poverty and you will
 be disappointed in the one you will fall into the other well give them up to health and you will be unfortunate give them up to magistracies honors country friends children in a word to any of the things which are not in mans power and you will be unfortunate but give them up to zeus and to the rest of the gods surrender them to the gods let the gods govern let your desire and aversion be ranged on the side of the gods and wherein will you be any longer unhappy but if lazy wretch you envy and complain and are jealous and fear and never cease for a single day complaining both of yourself and of the gods why do you still speak of being educated what kind of an education man do you mean that you have been employed about sophistical syllogisms συλλογισμοὺς μεταπίπτοντας will you not if it is possible unlearn all these things and begin from the beginning and see at the same time that hitherto you have not even touched the matter and then commencing from this foundation will you not build up all that comes after s
o that nothing may happen which you do not choose and nothing shall fail to happen which you do choose  give me one young man who has come to the school with this intention who is become a champion for this matter and says i give up everything else and it is enough for me if it shall ever be in my power to pass my life free from hindrance and free from trouble and to stretch out present my neck to all things like a free man and to look up to heaven as a friend of god and fear nothing that can happen let any of you point out such a man that i may say come young man into the possession of that which is your own for it is your destiny to adorn philosophy yours are these possessions yours these books yours these discourses then when he shall have labored sufficiently and exercised himself in this part of the matter τόπον let him come to me again and say i desire to be free from passion and free from perturbation and i wish as a pious man and a philosopher and a diligent person to know what is my duty to the gods 
what to my parents what to my brothers what to my country what to strangers i say come also to the second matter τόπον this also is yoursbut i have now sufficiently studied the second part τόπον also and i would gladly be secure and unshaken and not only when i am awake but also when i am asleep and when i am filled with wine and when i am melancholy man you are a god you have great designs  no but i wish to understand what chrysippus says in his treatise of the pseudomenos the liar will you not hang yourself wretch with such your intention and what good will it do you you will read the whole with sorrow and you will speak to others trembling thus you also do do you wish me brother to read to you and you to meyou write excellently my man and you also excellently in the style of xenophon and you in the style of plato and you in the style of antisthenes then having told your dreams to one another you return to the same things your desires are the same your aversions the same your pursuits are the same and your 
designs and purposes you wish for the same things and work for the same in the next place you do not even seek for one to give you advice but you are vexed if you hear such things as i say then you say an illnatured old fellow when i was going away he did not weep nor did he say into what danger you are going if you come off safe my child i will burn lights this is what a good natured man would do it will be a great thing for you if you do return safe and it will be worthwhile to burn lights for such a person for you ought to be immortal and exempt from disease  casting away then as i say this conceit of thinking that we know something useful we must come to philosophy as we apply to geometry and to music but if we do not we shall not even approach to proficiency though we read all the collections and commentaries of chrysippus and those of antipater and archedemus  xviii how we should struggle against appearances every habit and faculty is maintained and increased by the corresponding actions the habit of wa
