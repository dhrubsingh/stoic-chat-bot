us fronto         m cornelius fronto was a roman by descent but of provincial birth       being native to cirta in numidia thence he migrated to rome in the reign       of hadrian and became the most famous rhetorician of his day as a       pleader and orator he was counted by his contemporaries hardly inferior to       tully himself and as a teacher his aid was sought for the noblest youths       of rome to him was entrusted the education of m             aurelius and of his colleague l verus in their boyhood and he was       rewarded for his efforts by a seat in the senate and the consular rank       ad  by the exercise of his profession he became wealthy and if he       speaks of his means as not great       he must be comparing his wealth with the grandees of rome not with the       ordinary citizen             before the present century nothing was known of the works of fronto       except a grammatical treatise but in  cardinal mai published a number       of letters and some short essays of fronto whic
h he had discovered in a       palimpsest at milan other parts of the same ms he found later in the       vatican the whole being collected         references are made to the edition of naber leipzig trübner      ad verum imp aur caes ii  and edited in the year          we now possess parts of his correspondence with antoninus pius with m       aurelius with l verus and with certain of his friends and also several       rhetorical and historical fragments though none of the more ambitious       works of fronto have survived there are enough to give proof of his       powers never was a great literary reputation less deserved it would be       hard to conceive of anything more vapid than the style and conception of       these letters clearly the man was a pedant without imagination or taste       such indeed was the age he lived in and it is no marvel that he was like       to his age but there must have been more in him than mere pedantry there       was indeed a heart in the man which marcus found and he fo
und also a       tongue which could speak the truth frontos letters are by no means free       from exaggeration and laudation but they do not show that loathsome       flattery which filled the roman court he really admires what he praises       and his way of saying so is not unlike what often passes for criticism at       the present day he is not afraid to reprove what he thinks amiss and the       astonishment of marcus at this will prove if proof were needed that he       was not used to plain dealing how happy i am he writes that my       friend marcus cornelius so distinguished as an orator and so noble as a       man thinks me worth praising and blaming       in another place he deems himself blest because pronto had taught him to       speak the truth       although the context shows him to be speaking of expression it is still       a point in favour of pronto a sincere heart is better than literary       taste and if fronto had not done his duty by the young prince it is not       easy to understa
nd the friendship which remained between them up to the       last         ad m caes iii      ad m caes iii          an example of the frankness which was between them is given by a       difference they had over the case of herodes atticus herodes was a greek       rhetorician who had a school at rome and marcus aurelius was among his       pupils both marcus and the emperor antoninus had a high opinion of       herodes and all we know goes to prove he was a man of high character and       princely generosity when quite young he was made administrator of the       free cities in asia nor is it surprising to find that he made bitter       enemies there indeed a just ruler was sure to make enemies the end of       it was that an athenian deputation headed by the orators theodotus and       demostratus made serious accusations against his honour there is no need       to discuss the merits of the case here suffice it to say herodes       succeeded in defending himself to the satisfaction of the emperor pronto  
     appears to have taken the delegates part and to have accepted a brief       for the prosecution urged to some extent by personal considerations and       in this cause marcus aurelius writes to fronto as follows             aurelius cæsar to his friend fronto greeting         i know you have often told me you were anxious to find how you might       best please me now is the time now you can increase my love towards       you if it can be increased a trial is at hand in which people seem       likely not only to hear your speech with pleasure but to see your       indignation with impatience i see no one who dares give you a hint in       the matter for those who are less friendly prefer to see you act with       some inconsistency and those who are more friendly fear to seem too       friendly to your opponent if they should dissuade you from your       accusation then again in case you have prepared something neat for the       occasion they cannot endure to rob you of your harangue by silencing       
you therefore whether you think me a rash counsellor or a bold boy or       too kind to your opponent not because i think it better i will offer my       counsel with some caution but why have i said offer my counsel no i       demand it from you i demand it boldly and if i succeed i promise to       remain under your obligation what you will say if i am attackt shall i       not pay tit for tat ah but you will get greater glory if even when       attackt you answer nothing indeed if he begins it answer as you will       and you will have fair excuse but i have demanded of him that he shall       not begin and i think i have succeeded i love each of you according to       your merits and i know that lie was educated in the house of p       calvisius my grandfather and that i was educated by you therefore i am       full of anxiety that this most disagreeable business shall be managed as       honourably as possible i trust you may approve my advice for my       intention you will approve at least i prefer to 
write unwisely rather       than to be silent unkindly         ad m caes ii          fronto replied thanking the prince for his advice and promising that he       will confine himself to the facts of the case but he points out that the       charges brought against herodes were such that they can hardly be made       agreeable amongst them being spoliation violence and murder however       he is willing even to let some of these drop if it be the princes       pleasure to this marcus returned the following answer       this one thing my dearest fronto is enough to make me truly grateful       to you that so far from rejecting my counsel you have even approved it       as to the question you raise in your kind letter my opinion is this all       that concerns the case which you are supporting must be clearly brought       forward what concerns your own feelings though you may have had just       provocation should be left unsaid the story does credit to both       fronto shows no loss of temper at the interfer
ence nor shrinks from       stating his case with frankness and marcus with forbearance remarkable       in a prince does not command that his friend be left unmolested but       merely stipulates for a fair trial on the merits of the case         ad m caes iii          another example may be given from a letter of frontos       here is something else quarrelsome and querulous i have sometimes found       fault with you in your absence somewhat seriously in the company of a few       of my most intimate friends at times for example when you mixt in       society with a more solemn look than was fitting or would read books in       the theatre or in a banquet nor did i absent myself from theatre or       banquet when you did       then i used to call you a hard man no good company even disagreeable       sometimes when anger got the better of me but did any one else in the       same banquet speak against you i could not endure to hear it with       equanimity thus it was easier for me to say something to your
       disadvantage myself than to hear others do it just as i could more       easily bear to chastise my daughter gratia than to see her chastised by       another         ad m caes iv      the text is obscure         the affection between them is clear from every page of the correspondence       a few instances are now given which were written at different periods             to my master         this is how i have past the last few days my sister was suddenly seized       with an internal pain so violent that i was horrified at her looks my       mother in her trepidation on that account accidentally bruised her side       on a corner of the wall she and we were greatly troubled about that       blow for myself on going to rest i found a scorpion in my bed but i       did not lie down upon him i killed him first if you are getting on       better that is a consolation my mother is easier now thanks be to god       goodbye best and sweetest master my lady sends you greeting         ad m caes v    what     
  words can i find to fit my had luck or how shall i upbraid as it       deserves the hard constraint which is laid upon me it ties me fast here       troubled my heart is and beset by such anxiety nor does it allow me to       make haste to my fronto my life and delight to be near him at such a       moment of illhealth in particular to hold his hands to chafe gently       that identical foot so far as may be done without discomfort to attend       him in the bath to support his steps with my arm         ad m caes i    this       morning i did not write to you because i heard you were better and       because i was myself engaged in other business and i cannot ever endure       to write anything to you unless with mind at ease and untroubled and       free so if we are all right let me know what i desire you know and       how properly i desire it i know farewell my master always in every       chance first in my mind as you deserve to be my master see i am not       asleep and i compel myself to sleep that 
you may not be angry with me       you gather i am writing this late at night         iii    what       spirit do you suppose is in me when i remember how long it is since i       have seen you and why i have not seen you and it may be i shall not       see you for a few days yet while you are strengthening yourself as you       must so while you lie on the sickbed my spirit also will lie low anti       whenas       by gods mercy you shall stand upright my spirit too will stand firm       which is now burning with the strongest desire for you farewell soul of       your prince your pupil       o       my dear fronto most distinguished consul i yield you have conquered       all who have ever loved before you have conquered out and out in loves       contest receive the victors wreath and the herald shall proclaim your       victory aloud before your own tribunal m cornelius fronto consul       wins and is crowned victor in the open international       loverace       but beaten though i may be i shall neither 
slacken nor relax my own       zeal well you shall love me more than any man loves any other man but       i who possess a faculty of loving less strong shall love you more than       any one else loves you more indeed than you love yourself gratia and i       will have to fight for it i doubt i shall not get the better of her       for as plautus says her love is like rain whose big drops not only       penetrate the dress but drench to the very marrow         ad m caes iii      the writer sometimes uses archaisms such as quom which i render whenas     ad m caes ii      the writer parodies the proclamation at the greek games the words also are greek         marcus aurelius seems to have been about eighteen years of age when the       correspondence begins fronto being some thirty years       older       the systematic education of the young prince seems to have been finisht       and pronto now acts more as his adviser than his tutor he recommends the       prince to use simplicity in his public speeches and
 to avoid       affectation       marcus devotes his attention to the old authors who then had a great       vogue at rome ennius plautus nævius and such orators as cato and       gracchus       pronto urges on him the study of cicero whose letters he says are all       worth reading         from internal evidence the letters are not arranged in order of time see nahers prolegomena p xx foll     ad m caes iii x     ad m caes ii  iii  ii          when he wishes to compliment marcus he declares one or other of his       letters has the true tullian ring marcus gives his nights to reading when       he ought to be sleeping he exercises himself in verse composition and on       rhetorical themes             it is very nice of you he writes to fronto       to ask for my hexameters i would have sent them at once if i had them       by me the fact is my secretary anicetusyou know who i meandid not       pack up any of my compositions for me to take away with me he knows my       weakness he was afraid that if i got 
hold of them i might as usual       make smoke of them however there was no fear for the hexameters i must       confess the truth to my master i love them i study at night since the       day is taken up with the theatre i am weary of an evening and sleepy in       the daylight and so i dont do much yet i have made extracts from sixty       books five volumes of them in these latter days but when you read       remember that the sixty includes plays of novius and farces and some       little speeches of scipio dont be too much startled at the number you       remember your polemon but i pray you do not remember horace who has       died with pollio as far as i am concerned       farewell my dearest and most affectionate friend most distinguished       consul and my beloved master whom i have not seen these two years those       who say two months count the days shall i ever see you again         ad m caes ii      he implies as in i  that he has ceased to study horace         sometimes fronto sends him a them

o be feared that the fount of marcuss eloquence       was pumped up by artificial means         pollio was a grammarian who taught marcus     ad m caes v  v      ep gracae      ad anton imp ii    some idea of his literary style may be gathered from the letter which follows         i heard polemo declaim the other day to say something of things       sublunary if you ask what i thought of him listen he seems to me an       industrious farmer endowed with the greatest skill who has cultivated a       large estate for corn and vines only and indeed with a rich return of       fine crops but yet in that land of his there is no pompeian fig or       arician vegetable no tarentine rose or pleasing coppice or thick       grove or shady plane tree all is for use rather than for pleasure such       as one ought rather to commend but cares not to love         ad m caes ii          a pretty bold idea is it not and rash judgment to pass censure on a man       of such reputation but whenas i remember that i am writing to 
you i       think i am less bold than you would have me             in that point i am wholly undecided             theres an unpremeditated hendecasyllable for you so before i begin to       poetize ill take an easy with you farewell my hearts desire your       veruss best beloved most distinguisht consul master most sweet       farewell i ever pray sweetest soul             what a letter do you think you have written me i could make bold to say       that never did she who bore me and nurst me write anything so delightful       so honeysweet and this does not come of your fine style and eloquence       otherwise not my mother only but all who breathe             to the pupil never was anything on earth so fine as his masters       eloquence on this theme marcus fairly bubbles over with enthusiasm       well       if the ancient greeks ever wrote anything like this let those who know       decide it for me if i dare say so i never read any invective of catos       so fine as your encomtum o if my       lord

    have had no fear of this admonition many things help me to enter within       your school i write this in the utmost haste for whenas i am sending       you so kindly a letter from my lord what needs a longer letter of mine       farewell then glory of roman eloquence boast of your friends       magnifico most delightful man most distinguished consul master most       sweet         ad m caes ii      the emperor antoninus pius is spoken of as dominus meus     this sentence is written in greek     several of these words are greek and the meaning is not quite clear         after this you will take care not to tell so many fibs of me especially       in the senate a monstrous fine speech this is o if i could kiss your       head at every heading of it you have looked down on all with a vengeance       this oration once read in vain shall we study in vain shall we toil in       vain strain every nerve farewell always most sweet master             sometimes fronto descends from the heights of eloquence to offer
 practical       advice as when he suggests how marcus should deal with his suite it is       more difficult he admits to keep courtiers in harmony than to tame lions       with a lute but if it is to be done it must be by eradicating jealousy       do not let your friends says fronto       envy each other or think that what you give to another is filched from       them         ad m caes iv          keep away envy from your suite and you will find your friends kindly and       harmonious             here and there we meet with allusions to his daily life which we could       wish to be more frequent he goes to the theatre or the lawcourts       or takes part in court ceremony but his heart is always with his       books the vintage season with its religious rites was always       spent by antoninus pius in the country the following letters       give sonic notion of a days occupation at that time     ii      iv          my dearest masteri am well today i studied from the ninth hour       of the night to the
