introduction       marcus aurelius antoninus was born on april  ad  his real name was m annius verus and he was sprung of a noble family which claimed descent from numa second king of rome thus the most religious of emperors came of the blood of the most pious of early kings his father annius verus had held high office in rome and his grandfather of the same name had been thrice consul both his parents died young but marcus held them in loving remembrance on his fathers death marcus was adopted by his grandfather the consular annius verus and there was deep love between these two on the very first page of his book marcus gratefully declares how of his grandfather he had learned to be gentle and meek and to refrain from all anger and passion the emperor hadrian divined the fine character of the lad whom he used to call not verus but verissimus more truthful than his own name he advanced marcus to equestrian rank when six years of age and at the age of eight made him a member of the ancient salian priesthood th
e boys aunt annia galeria faustina was married to antoninus pius afterwards emperor hence it came about that antoninus having no son adopted marcus changing his name to that which he is known by and betrothed him to his daughter faustina his education was conducted with all care the ablest teachers were engaged for him and he was trained in the strict doctrine of the stoic philosophy which was his great delight he was taught to dress plainly and to live simply to avoid all softness and luxury his body was trained to hardihood by wrestling hunting and outdoor games and though his constitution was weak he showed great personal courage to encounter the fiercest boars at the same time he was kept from the extravagancies of his day the great excitement in rome was the strife of the factions as they were called in the circus the racing drivers used to adopt one of four coloursred blue white or greenand their partisans showed an eagerness in supporting them which nothing could surpass riot and corruption went in the
 train of the racing chariots and from all these things marcus held severely aloof   in  marcus was raised to the consulship and in  his betrothal was consummated by marriage two years later faustina brought him a daughter and soon after the tribunate and other imperial honours were conferred upon him   antoninus pius died in  and marcus assumed the imperial state he at once associated with himself l ceionius commodus whom antoninus had adopted as a younger son at the same time with marcus giving him the name of lucius aurelius verus henceforth the two are colleagues in the empire the junior being trained as it were to succeed no sooner was marcus settled upon the throne than wars broke out on all sides in the east vologeses iii of parthia began a longmeditated revolt by destroying a whole roman legion and invading syria  verus was sent off in hot haste to quell this rising and he fulfilled his trust by plunging into drunkenness and debauchery while the war was left to his officers soon after marcus had to fa
ce a more serious danger at home in the coalition of several powerful tribes on the northern frontier chief among those were the marcomanni or marchmen the quadi mentioned in this book the sarmatians the catti the jazyges in rome itself there was pestilence and starvation the one brought from the east by veruss legions the other caused by floods which had destroyed vast quantities of grain after all had been done possible to allay famine and to supply pressing needsmarcus being forced even to sell the imperial jewels to find moneyboth emperors set forth to a struggle which was to continue more or less during the rest of marcuss reign during these wars in  verus died we have no means of following the campaigns in detail but thus much is certain that in the end the romans succeeded in crushing the barbarian tribes and effecting a settlement which made the empire more secure marcus was himself commanderinchief and victory was due no less to his own ability than to his wisdom in choice of lieutenants shown conspi
cuously in the case of pertinax there were several important battles fought in these campaigns and one of them has become celebrated for the legend of the thundering legion in a battle against the quadi in  the day seemed to be going in favour of the foe when on a sudden arose a great storm of thunder and rain the lightning struck the barbarians with terror and they turned to rout in later days this storm was said to have been sent in answer to the prayers of a legion which contained many christians and the name thundering legion should be given to it on this account the title of thundering legion is known at an earlier date so this part of the story at least cannot be true but the aid of the storm is acknowledged by one of the scenes carved on antonines column at rome which commemorates these wars   the settlement made after these troubles might have been more satisfactory but for an unexpected rising in the east avidius cassius an able captain who had won renown in the parthian wars was at this time chief g
overnor of the eastern provinces by whatever means induced he had conceived the project of proclaiming himself emperor as soon as marcus who was then in feeble health should die and a report having been conveyed to him that marcus was dead cassius did as he had planned marcus on hearing the news immediately patched up a peace and returned home to meet this new peril the emperors great grief was that he must needs engage in the horrors of civil strife he praised the qualities of cassius and expressed a heartfelt wish that cassius might not be driven to do himself a hurt before he should have the opportunity to grant a free pardon but before he could come to the east news had come to cassius that the emperor still lived his followers fell away from him and he was assassinated marcus now went to the east and while there the murderers brought the head of cassius to him but the emperor indignantly refused their gift nor would he admit the men to his presence   on this journey his wife faustina died at his return t
he emperor celebrated a triumph  immediately afterwards he repaired to germany and took up once more the burden of war his operations were followed by complete success but the troubles of late years had been too much for his constitution at no time robust and on march   he died in pannonia   the good emperor was not spared domestic troubles faustina had borne him several children of whom he was passionately fond their innocent faces may still be seen in many a sculpture gallery recalling with odd effect the dreamy countenance of their father but they died one by one and when marcus came to his own end only one of his sons still livedthe weak and worthless commodus on his fathers death commodus who succeeded him undid the work of many campaigns by a hasty and unwise peace and his reign of twelve years proved him to be a ferocious and bloodthirsty tyrant scandal has made free with the name of faustina herself who is accused not only of unfaithfulness but of intriguing with cassius and egging him on to his fatal
 rebellion it must be admitted that these charges rest on no sure evidence and the emperor at all events loved her dearly nor ever felt the slightest qualm of suspicion   as a soldier we have seen that marcus was both capable and successful as an administrator he was prudent and conscientious although steeped in the teachings of philosophy he did not attempt to remodel the world on any preconceived plan he trod the path beaten by his predecessors seeking only to do his duty as well as he could and to keep out corruption he did some unwise things it is true to create a compeer in empire as he did with verus was a dangerous innovation which could only succeed if one of the two effaced himself and under diocletian this very precedent caused the roman empire to split into halves he erred in his civil administration by too much centralising but the strong point of his reign was the administration of justice marcus sought bylaws to protect the weak to make the lot of the slaves less hard to stand in place of father
 to the fatherless charitable foundations were endowed for rearing and educating poor children the provinces were protected against oppression and public help was given to cities or districts which might be visited by calamity the great blot on his name and one hard indeed to explain is his treatment of the christians in his reign justin at rome became a martyr to his faith and polycarp at smyrna and we know of many outbreaks of fanaticism in the provinces which caused the death of the faithful it is no excuse to plead that he knew nothing about the atrocities done in his name it was his duty to know and if he did not he would have been the first to confess that he had failed in his duty but from his own tone in speaking of the christians it is clear he knew them only from calumny and we hear of no measures taken even to secure that they should have a fair hearing in this respect trajan was better than he   to a thoughtful mind such a religion as that of rome would give small satisfaction its legends were oft
en childish or impossible its teaching had little to do with morality the roman religion was in fact of the nature of a bargain men paid certain sacrifices and rites and the gods granted their favour irrespective of right or wrong in this case all devout souls were thrown back upon philosophy as they had been though to a less extent in greece there were under the early empire two rival schools which practically divided the field between them stoicism and epicureanism the ideal set before each was nominally much the same the stoics aspired to ἁπάθεια the repression of all emotion and the epicureans to ἀταραξία freedom from all disturbance yet in the upshot the one has become a synonym of stubborn endurance the other for unbridled licence with epicureanism we have nothing to do now but it will be worth while to sketch the history and tenets of the stoic sect   zeno the founder of stoicism was born in cyprus at some date unknown but his life may be said roughly to be between the years  and  bc cyprus has been fr
om time immemorial a meetingplace of the east and west and although we cannot grant any importance to a possible strain of phœnician blood in him for the phoenicians were no philosophers yet it is quite likely that through asia minor he may have come in touch with the far east he studied under the cynic crates but he did not neglect other philosophical systems after many years study he opened his own school in a colonnade in athens called the painted porch or stoa which gave the stoics their name next to zeno the school of the porch owes most to chrysippus  bc who organised stoicism into a system of him it was said   but for chrysippus there had been no porch   the stoics regarded speculation as a means to an end and that end was as zeno put it to live consistently ὁμολογουμένος ζῆν or as it was later explained to live in conformity with nature ὁμολογουμένος τῇ φύσει ζῆν this conforming of the life to nature was the stoic idea of virtue this dictum might easily be taken to mean that virtue consists in yieldin
g to each natural impulse but that was very far from the stoic meaning in order to live in accord with nature it is necessary to know what nature is and to this end a threefold division of philosophy is madeinto physics dealing with the universe and its laws the problems of divine government and teleology logic which trains the mind to discern true from false and ethics which applies the knowledge thus gained and tested to practical life   the stoic system of physics was materialism with an infusion of pantheism in contradiction to platos view that the ideas or prototypes of phenomena alone really exist the stoics held that material objects alone existed but immanent in the material universe was a spiritual force which acted through them manifesting itself under many forms as fire æther spirit soul reason the ruling principle   the universe then is god of whom the popular gods are manifestations while legends and myths are allegorical the soul of man is thus an emanation from the godhead into whom it will eve
ntually be reabsorbed the divine ruling principle makes all things work together for good but for the good of the whole the highest good of man is consciously to work with god for the common good and this is the sense in which the stoic tried to live in accord with nature in the individual it is virtue alone which enables him to do this as providence rules the universe so virtue in the soul must rule man   in logic the stoic system is noteworthy for their theory as to the test of truth the criterion they compared the newborn soul to a sheet of paper ready for writing upon this the senses write their impressions φαντασίαι and by experience of a number of these the soul unconsciously conceives general notions κοιναὶ ἔννοιαι or anticipations προλήψεις when the impression was such as to be irresistible it was called καταληπτικὴ φαντασία one that holds fast or as they explained it one proceeding from truth ideas and inferences artificially produced by deduction or the like were tested by this holding perception of
 the ethical application i have already spoken the highest good was the virtuous life virtue alone is happiness and vice is unhappiness carrying this theory to its extreme the stoic said that there could be no gradations between virtue and vice though of course each has its special manifestations moreover nothing is good but virtue and nothing but vice is bad those outside things which are commonly called good or bad such as health and sickness wealth and poverty pleasure and pain are to him indifferent ἀδιάφορα all these things are merely the sphere in which virtue may act the ideal wise man is sufficient unto himself in all things αὐταρκής and knowing these truths he will be happy even when stretched upon the rack it is probable that no stoic claimed for himself that he was this wise man but that each strove after it as an ideal much as the christian strives after a likeness to christ the exaggeration in this statement was however so obvious that the later stoics were driven to make a further subdivision of
 things indifferent into what is preferable προηγμένα and what is undesirable ἀποπροηγμένα they also held that for him who had not attained to the perfect wisdom certain actions were proper καθήκοντα these were neither virtuous nor vicious but like the indifferent things held a middle place   two points in the stoic system deserve special mention one is a careful distinction between things which are in our power and things which are not desire and dislike opinion and affection are within the power of the will whereas health wealth honour and other such are generally not so the stoic was called upon to control his desires and affections and to guide his opinion to bring his whole being under the sway of the will or leading principle just as the universe is guided and governed by divine providence this is a special application of the favourite greek virtue of moderation σωφροσύνη and has also its parallel in christian ethics the second point is a strong insistence on the unity of the universe and on mans duty a
s part of a great whole public spirit was the most splendid political virtue of the ancient world and it is here made cosmopolitan it is again instructive to note that christian sages insisted on the same thing christians are taught that they are members of a worldwide brotherhood where is neither greek nor hebrew bond nor free and that they live their lives as fellowworkers with god   such is the system which underlies the meditations of marcus aurelius some knowledge of it is necessary to the right understanding of the book but for us the chief interest lies elsewhere we do not come to marcus aurelius for a treatise on stoicism he is no head of a school to lay down a body of doctrine for students he does not even contemplate that others should read what he writes his philosophy is not an eager intellectual inquiry but more what we should call religious feeling the uncompromising stiffness of zeno or chrysippus is softened and transformed by passing through a nature reverent and tolerant gentle and free from
 guile the grim resignation which made life possible to the stoic sage becomes in him almost a mood of aspiration his book records the innermost thoughts of his heart set down to ease it with such moral maxims and reflections as may help him to bear the burden of duty and the countless annoyances of a busy life   it is instructive to compare the meditations with another famous book the imitation of christ there is the same ideal of selfcontrol in both it should be a mans task says the imitation to overcome himself and every day to be stronger than himself in withstanding of the passions standeth very peace of heart let us set the axe to the root that we being purged of our passions may have a peaceable mind to this end there must be continual selfexamination if thou may not continually gather thyself together namely sometimes do it at least once a day the morning or the evening in the morning purpose in the evening discuss the manner what thou hast been this day in word work and thought but while the romans t
emper is a modest selfreliance the christian aims at a more passive mood humbleness and meekness and reliance on the presence and personal friendship of god the roman scrutinises his faults with severity but without the selfcontempt which makes the christian vile in his own sight the christian like the roman bids study to withdraw thine heart from the love of things visible but it is not the busy life of duty he has in mind so much as the contempt of all worldly things and the cutting away of all lower delectations both rate mens praise or blame at their real worthlessness let not thy peace says the christian be in the mouths of men but it is to gods censure the christian appeals the roman to his own soul the petty annoyances of injustice or unkindness are looked on by each with the same magnanimity why doth a little thing said or done against thee make thee sorry it is no new thing it is not the first nor shall it be the last if thou live long at best suffer patiently if thou canst not suffer joyously the ch
ristian should sorrow more for other mens malice than for our own wrongs but the roman is inclined to wash his hands of the offender study to be patient in suffering and bearing other mens defaults and all manner infirmities says the christian but the roman would never have thought to add if all men were perfect what had we then to suffer of other men for god the virtue of suffering in itself is an idea which does not meet us in the meditations both alike realise that man is one of a great community no man is sufficient to himself says the christian we must bear together help together comfort together but while he sees a chief importance in zeal in exalted emotion that is and avoidance of lukewarmness the roman thought mainly of the duty to be done as well as might be and less of the feeling which should go with the doing of it to the saint as to the emperor the world is a poor thing at best verily it is a misery to live upon the earth says the christian few and evil are the days of mans life which passeth aw
ay suddenly as a shadow   but there is one great difference between the two books we are considering the imitation is addressed to others the meditations by the writer to himself we learn nothing from the imitation of the authors own life except in so far as he may be assumed to have practised his own preachings the meditations reflect mood by mood the mind of him who wrote them in their intimacy and frankness lies their great charm these notes are not sermons they are not even confessions there is always an air of selfconsciousness in confessions in such revelations there is always a danger of unctuousness or of vulgarity for the best of men st augustine is not always clear of offence and john bunyan himself exaggerates venial peccadilloes into heinous sins but marcus aurelius is neither vulgar nor unctuous he extenuates nothing but nothing sets down in malice he never poses before an audience he may not be profound he is always sincere and it is a lofty and serene soul which is here disclosed before us vulg
ar vices seem to have no temptation for him this is not one tied and bound with chains which he strives to break the faults he detects in himself are often such as most men would have no eyes to see to serve the divine spirit which is implanted within him a man must keep himself pure from all violent passion and evil affection from all rashness and vanity and from all manner of discontent either in regard of the gods or men or as he says elsewhere unspotted by pleasure undaunted by pain unwavering courtesy and consideration are his aims whatsoever any man either doth or saith thou must be good doth any man offend it is against himself that he doth offend why should it trouble thee the offender needs pity not wrath those who must needs be corrected should be treated with tact and gentleness and one must be always ready to learn better the best kind of revenge is not to become like unto them there are so many hints of offence forgiven that we may believe the notes followed sharp on the facts perhaps he has fall
en short of his aim and thus seeks to call his principles to mind and to strengthen himself for the future that these sayings are not mere talk is plain from the story of avidius cassius who would have usurped his imperial throne thus the emperor faithfully carries out his own principle that evil must be overcome with good for each fault in others nature says he has given us a counteracting virtue as for example against the unthankful it hath given goodness and meekness as an antidote   one so gentle towards a foe was sure to be a good friend and indeed his pages are full of generous gratitude to those who had served him in his first book he sets down to account all the debts due to his kinsfolk and teachers to his grandfather he owed his own gentle spirit to his father shamefastness and courage he learnt of his mother to be religious and bountiful and singleminded rusticus did not work in vain if he showed his pupil that his life needed amending apollonius taught him simplicity reasonableness gratitude a lov
e of true liberty so the list runs on every one he had dealings with seems to have given him something good a sure proof of the goodness of his nature which thought no evil   if his was that honest and true heart which is the christian ideal this is the more wonderful in that he lacked the faith which makes christians strong he could say it is true either there is a god and then all is well or if all things go by chance and fortune yet mayest thou use thine own providence in those things that concern thee properly and then art thou well or again we must needs grant that there is a nature that doth govern the universe but his own part in the scheme of things is so small that he does not hope for any personal happiness beyond what a serene soul may win in this mortal life o my soul the time i trust will be when thou shalt be good simple more open and visible than that body by which it is enclosed but this is said of the calm contentment with human lot which he hopes to attain not of a time when the trammels of 
the body shall be cast off for the rest the world and its fame and wealth all is vanity the gods may perhaps have a particular care for him but their especial care is for the universe at large thus much should suffice his gods are better than the stoic gods who sit aloof from all human things untroubled and uncaring but his personal hope is hardly stronger on this point he says little though there are many allusions to death as the natural end doubtless he expected his soul one day to be absorbed into the universal soul since nothing comes out of nothing and nothing can be annihilated his mood is one of strenuous weariness he does his duty as a good soldier waiting for the sound of the trumpet which shall sound the retreat he has not that cheerful confidence which led socrates through a life no less noble to a death which was to bring him into the company of gods he had worshipped and men whom he had revered   but although marcus aurelius may have held intellectually that his soul was destined to be absorbed 
and to lose consciousness of itself there were times when he felt as all who hold it must sometimes feel how unsatisfying is such a creed then he gropes blindly after something less empty and vain thou hast taken ship he says thou hast sailed thou art come to land go out if to another life there also shalt thou find gods who are everywhere there is more in this than the assumption of a rival theory for arguments sake if worldly things be but as a dream the thought is not far off that there may be an awakening to what is real when he speaks of death as a necessary change and points out that nothing useful and profitable can be brought about without change did he perhaps think of the change in a corn of wheat which is not quickened except it die natures marvellous power of recreating out of corruption is surely not confined to bodily things many of his thoughts sound like faroff echoes of st paul and it is strange indeed that this most christian of emperors has nothing good to say of the christians to him they 
are only sectaries violently and passionately set upon opposition   profound as philosophy these meditations certainly are not but marcus aurelius was too sincere not to see the essence of such things as came within his experience ancient religions were for the most part concerned with outward things do the necessary rites and you propitiate the gods and these rites were often trivial sometimes violated right feeling or even morality even when the gods stood on the side of righteousness they were concerned with the act more than with the intent but marcus aurelius knows that what the heart is full of the man will do such as thy thoughts and ordinary cogitations are he says such will thy mind be in time and every page of the book shows us that he knew thought was sure to issue in act he drills his soul as it were in right principles that when the time comes it may be guided by them to wait until the emergency is to be too late   he sees also the true essence of happiness if happiness did consist in pleasure ho

north and took measures to meet it as it was his settlement gave two centuries of respite to the roman empire had he fulfilled the plan of pushing the imperial frontiers to the elbe which seems to have been in his mind much more might have been accomplished but death cut short his designs   truly a rare opportunity was given to marcus aurelius of showing what the mind can do in despite of circumstances most peaceful of warriors a magnificent monarch whose ideal was quiet happiness in home life bent to obscurity yet born to greatness the loving father of children who died young or turned out hateful his life was one paradox that nothing might lack it was in camp before the face of the enemy that he passed away and went to his own place   the following is a list of the chief english translations of marcus aurelius  by meric casaubon   jeremy collier   james thomson   r graves   h mccormac   george long   g h rendall  and  j jackson  renans marcaurèlein his history of the origins of christianity which appeared i

 themselves weak and in the fruition intemperate       but to hold out firm and constant and to keep within the compass of true       moderation and sobriety in either estate is proper to a man who hath a       perfect and invincible soul such as he showed himself in the sickness of       maximus             xiv from the gods i received that i had good grandfathers and parents       a good sister good masters good domestics loving kinsmen almost all       that i have and that i never through haste and rashness transgressed       against any of them notwithstanding that my disposition was such as that       such a thing if occasion had been might very well have been committed by       me but that it was the mercy of the gods to prevent such a concurring of       matters and occasions as might make me to incur this blame that i was       not long brought up by the concubine of my father that i preserved the       flower of my youth that i took not upon me to be a man before my time       but rather put it off l

 perchance i might       have dwelt upon if i had found myself to go on in them with success that       i did by times prefer those by whom i was brought up to such places and       dignities which they seemed unto me most to desire and that i did not       put them off with hope and expectation that since that they were yet but       young i would do the same hereafter that i ever knew apollonius and       rusticus and maximus that i have had occasion often and effectually to       consider and meditate with myself concerning that life which is according       to nature what the nature and manner of it is so that as for the gods       and such suggestions helps and inspirations as might be expected from       them nothing did hinder but that i might have begun long before to live       according to nature or that even now that i was not yet partaker and in       present possession of that life that i myself in that i did not observe       those inward motions and suggestions yea and almost plain and apparent
       instructions and admonitions of the gods was the only cause of it that       my body in such a life hath been able to hold out so long that i never       had to do with benedicta and theodotus yea and afterwards when i fell       into some fits of love i was soon cured that having been often       displeased with rusticus i never did him anything for which afterwards i       had occasion to repent that it being so that my mother was to die young       yet she lived with me all her latter years that as often as i had a       purpose to help and succour any that either were poor or fallen into some       present necessity i never was answered by my officers that there was not       ready money enough to do it and that i myself never had occasion to       require the like succour from any other that i have such a wife so       obedient so loving so ingenuous that i had choice of fit and able men       to whom i might commit the bringing up of my children that by dreams i       have received help as for ot
her things so in particular how i might       stay my casting of blood and cure my dizziness as that also that       happened to thee in cajeta as unto chryses when he prayed by the       seashore and when i did first apply myself to philosophy that i did not       fall into the hands of some sophists or spent my time either in reading       the manifold volumes of ordinary philosophers nor in practising myself in       the solution of arguments and fallacies nor dwelt upon the studies of the       meteors and other natural curiosities all these things without the       assistance of the gods and fortune could not have been             xv in the country of the quadi at granua these betimes in the morning       say to thyself this day i shalt have to do with an idle curious man with       an unthankful man a railer a crafty false or an envious man an       unsociable uncharitable man all these ill qualities have happened unto       them through ignorance of that which is truly good and truly bad but i       th

 a vulgar       sense such things i grant may be compared says well and like a       philosopher that those sins are greater which are committed through lust       than those which are committed through anger for he that is angry seems       with a kind of grief and close contraction of himself to turn away from       reason but he that sins through lust being overcome by pleasure doth in       his very sin bewray a more impotent and unmanlike disposition well then       and like a philosopher doth he say that he of the two is the more to be       condemned that sins with pleasure than he that sins with grief for       indeed this latter may seem first to have been wronged and so in some       manner through grief thereof to have been forced to be angry whereas he       who through lust doth commit anything did of himself merely resolve upon       that action              viii whatsoever thou dost affect whatsoever thou dost project so do       and so project all as one who for aught thou knowest may at this

e things or if not as ignorant of them yet as unable       either to prevent or better to order and dispose them it cannot be that       she through want either of power or skill should have committed such a       thing so as to suffer all things both good and bad equally and       promiscuously to happen unto all both good and bad as for life       therefore and death honour and dishonour labour and pleasure riches       and poverty all these things happen unto men indeed both good and bad       equally but as things which of themselves are neither good nor bad       because of themselves neither shameful nor praiseworthy              ix consider how quickly all things are dissolved and resolved the       bodies and substances themselves into the matter and substance of the       world and their memories into the general age and time of the world       consider the nature of all worldly sensible things of those especially       which either ensnare by pleasure or for their irksomeness are dreadful       or f

hite and black with a kind of pity and       compassion also              xii if thou shouldst live three thousand or as many as ten thousands       of years yet remember this that man can part with no life properly save       with that little part of life which he now lives and that which he       lives is no other than that which at every instant he parts with that       then which is longest of duration and that which is shortest come both       to one effect for although in regard of that which is already past there       may be some inequality yet that time which is now present and in being       is equal unto all men and that being it which we part with whensoever we       die it doth manifestly appear that it can be but a moment of time that       we then part with for as for that which is either past or to come a man       cannot be said properly to part with it for how should a man part with       that which he hath not these two things therefore thou must remember       first that all things in the 
world from all eternity by a perpetual       revolution of the same times and things ever continued and renewed are of       one kind and nature so that whether for a hundred or two hundred years       only or for an infinite space of time a man see those things which are       still the same it can be no matter of great moment and secondly that       that life which any the longest liver or the shortest liver parts with       is for length and duration the very same for that only which is present       is that which either of them can lose as being that only which they       have for that which he hath not no man can truly be said to lose              xiii remember that all is but opinion and conceit for those things       are plain and apparent which were spoken unto monimus the cynic and as       plain and apparent is the use that may be made of those things if that       which is true and serious in them be received as well as that which is       sweet and pleasing              xiv a mans soul doth wrong

       prayed for and for whom i have taken such care even they would have me       die hoping that after my death they shall live happier than they did       before what then should any man desire to continue here any longer       nevertheless whensoever thou diest thou must not be less kind and loving       unto them for it but as before see them continue to be their friend to       wish them well and meekly and gently to carry thyself towards them but       yet so that on the other side it make thee not the more unwilling to die       but as it fareth with them that die an easy quick death whose soul is       soon separated from their bodies so must thy separation from them be to       these had nature joined and annexed me now she parts us i am ready to       depart as from friends and kinsmen but yet without either reluctancy or       compulsion for this also is according to nature              xxxvii use thyself as often as thou seest any man do anything       presently if it be possible to say unto thy
self what is this mans end       in this his action but begin this course with thyself first of all and       diligently examine thyself concerning whatsoever thou doest              xxxviii remember that that which sets a man at work and hath power       over the affections to draw them either one way or the other way is not       any external thing properly but that which is hidden within every mans       dogmata and opinions that that is rhetoric that is life that to       speak true is man himself as for thy body which as a vessel or a case       compasseth thee about and the many and curious instruments that it hath       annexed unto it let them not trouble thy thoughts for of themselves they       are but as a carpenters axe but that they are born with us and       naturally sticking unto us but otherwise without the inward cause that       hath power to move them and to restrain them those parts are of       themselves of no more use unto us than the shuttle is of itself to the       weaver or the pen

stitution of man              v tragedies were at first brought in and instituted to put men in mind       of worldly chances and casualties that these things in the ordinary       course of nature did so happen that men that were much pleased and       delighted by such accidents upon this stage would not by the same things       in a greater stage be grieved and afflicted for here you see what is the       end of all such things and that even they that cry out so mournfully to       cithaeron must bear them for all their cries and exclamations as well as       others and in very truth many good things are spoken by these poets as       that for example is an excellent passage but if so be that i and my       two children be neglected by the gods they have some reason even for       that c and again it will but little avail thee to storm and rage       against the things themselves c again to reap ones life as a       ripe ear of corn and whatsoever else is to be found in them that is of       the same kind 
after the tragedy the ancient comedy was brought in which       had the liberty to inveigh against personal vices being therefore through       this her freedom and liberty of speech of very good use and effect to       restrain men from pride and arrogancy to which end it was that diogenes       took also the same liberty after these what were either the middle or       new comedy admitted for but merely or for the most part at least for       the delight and pleasure of curious and excellent imitation it will       steal away look to it c why no man denies but that these also       have some good things whereof that may be one but the whole drift and       foundation of that kind of dramatical poetry what is it else but as we       have said              vi how clearly doth it appear unto thee that no other course of thy       life could fit a true philosophers practice better than this very       course that thou art now already in              vii a branch cut off from the continuity of that which was nex
t unto       it must needs be cut off from the whole tree so a man that is divided       from another man is divided from the whole society a branch is cut off       by another but he that hates and is averse cuts himself off from his       neighbour and knows not that at the same time he divides himself from the       whole body or corporation but herein is the gift and mercy of god the       author of this society in that once cut off we may grow together and       become part of the whole again but if this happen often the misery is       that the further a man is run in this division the harder he is to be       reunited and restored again and however the branch which once cut of       afterwards was graffed in gardeners can tell you is not like that which       sprouted together at first and still continued in the unity of the body              viii to grow together like fellow branches in matter of good       correspondence and affection but not in matter of opinions they that       shall oppose thee in
 thy right courses as it is not in their power to       divert thee from thy good action so neither let it be to divert thee from       thy good affection towards them but be it thy care to keep thyself       constant in both both in a right judgment and action and in true       meekness towards them that either shall do their endeavour to hinder       thee or at least will be displeased with thee for what thou hast done       for to fail in either either in the one to give over for fear or in the       other to forsake thy natural affection towards him who by nature is both       thy friend and thy kinsman is equally base and much savouring of the       disposition of a cowardly fugitive soldier              ix it is not possible that any nature should be inferior unto art       since that all arts imitate nature if this be so that the most perfect       and general nature of all natures should in her operation come short of       the skill of arts is most improbable now common is it to all arts to       mak

in and lurk in some corner it is in our power to wipe them       off remembering moreover that this care and circumspection of thine is       to continue but for a while and then thy life will be at an end and what       should hinder but that thou mayest do well with all these things for if       they be according to nature rejoice in them and let them be pleasing and       acceptable unto thee but if they be against nature seek thou that which       is according to thine own nature and whether it be for thy credit or no       use all possible speed for the attainment of it for no man ought to be       blamed for seeking his own good and happiness              xvi of everything thou must consider from whence it came of what       things it doth consist and into what it will be changed what will be the       nature of it or what it will be like unto when it is changed and that it       can suffer no hurt by this change and as for other mens either       foolishness or wickedness that it may not trouble and gr

t they do them against their wills and       through mere ignorance for as according to platos opinion no soul doth       willingly err so by consequent neither doth it anything otherwise than it       ought but against her will therefore are they grieved whensoever they       hear themselves charged either of injustice or unconscionableness or       covetousness or in general of any injurious kind of dealing towards       their neighbours fourthly that thou thyself doest transgress in many       things and art even such another as they are and though perchance thou       doest forbear the very act of some sins yet hast thou in thyself an       habitual disposition to them but that either through fear or vainglory       or some such other ambitious foolish respect thou art restrained       fifthly that whether they have sinned or no thou doest not understand       perfectly for many things are done by way of discreet policy and       generally a man must know many things first before he be able truly and     
  judiciously to judge of another mans action sixthly that whensoever       thou doest take on grievously or makest great woe little doest thou       remember then that a mans life is but for a moment of time and that       within a while we shall all be in our graves seventhly that it is not       the sins and transgressions themselves that trouble us properly for they       have their existence in their minds and understandings only that commit       them but our own opinions concerning those sins remove then and be       content to part with that conceit of thine that it is a grievous thing       and thou hast removed thine anger but how should i remove it how       reasoning with thyself that it is not shameful for if that which is       shameful be not the only true evil that is thou also wilt be driven       whilest thou doest follow the common instinct of nature to avoid that       which is evil to commit many unjust things and to become a thief and       anything that will make to the attainment of th
y intended worldly ends       eighthly how many things may and do oftentimes follow upon such fits of       anger and grief far more grievous in themselves than those very things       which we are so grieved or angry for ninthly that meekness is a thing       unconquerable if it be true and natural and not affected or       hypocritical for how shall even the most fierce and malicious that thou       shalt conceive be able to hold on against thee if thou shalt still       continue meek and loving unto him and that even at that time when he is       about to do thee wrong thou shalt be well disposed and in good temper       with all meekness to teach him and to instruct him better as for       example my son we were not born for this to hurt and annoy one another       it will be thy hurt not mine my son and so to show him forcibly and       fully that it is so in very deed and that neither bees do it one to       another nor any other creatures that are naturally sociable but this       thou must do not scof
fingly not by way of exprobation but tenderly       without any harshness of words neither must thou do it by way of       exercise or ostentation that they that are by and hear thee may admire       thee but so always that nobody be privy to it but himself alone yea       though there be more present at the same time these nine particular       heads as so many gifts from the muses see that thou remember well and       begin one day whilest thou art yet alive to be a man indeed but on the       other side thou must take heed as much to flatter them as to be angry       with them for both are equally uncharitable and equally hurtful and in       thy passions take it presently to thy consideration that to be angry is       not the part of a man but that to be meek and gentle as it savours of       more humanity so of more manhood that in this there is strength and       nerves or vigour and fortitude whereof anger and indignation is       altogether void for the nearer everything is unto unpassionateness the  
     nearer it is unto power and as grief doth proceed from weakness so doth       anger for both both he that is angry and that grieveth have received a       wound and cowardly have as it were yielded themselves unto their       affections if thou wilt have a tenth also receive this tenth gift from       hercules the guide and leader of the muses that is a mad mans part to       look that there should be no wicked men in the world because it is       impossible now for a man to brook well enough that there should be       wicked men in the world but not to endure that any should transgress       against himself is against all equity and indeed tyrannical              xvii four several dispositions or inclinations there be of the mind and       understanding which to be aware of thou must carefully observe and       whensoever thou doest discover them thou must rectify them saying to       thyself concerning every one of them this imagination is not necessary       this is uncharitable this thou shalt speak 
as another mans slave or       instrument than which nothing can be more senseless and absurd for the       fourth thou shalt sharply check and upbraid thyself for that thou doest       suffer that more divine part in thee to become subject and obnoxious to       that more ignoble part of thy body and the gross lusts and concupiscences       thereof              xviii what portion soever either of air or fire there be in thee       although by nature it tend upwards submitting nevertheless to the       ordinance of the universe it abides here below in this mixed body so       whatsoever is in thee either earthy or humid although by nature it tend       downwards yet is it against its nature both raised upwards and standing       or consistent so obedient are even the elements themselves to the       universe abiding patiently wheresoever though against their nature they       are placed until the sound as it were of their retreat and separation       is it not a grievous thing then that thy reasonable part on

 object and as for earnest longing that we should       altogether avoid it and to use averseness in those things only that       wholly depend of our own wills it is not about ordinary petty matters       believe it that all our strife and contention is but whether with the       vulgar we should be mad or by the help of philosophy wise and sober       said he xxxii socrates said what will you have the souls of       reasonable or unreasonable creatures of reasonable but what of those       whose reason is sound and perfect or of those whose reason is vitiated       and corrupted of those whose reason is sound and perfect why then labour       ye not for such because we have them already what then do ye so strive       and contend between you               the twelfth book              i whatsoever thou doest hereafter aspire unto thou mayest even now       enjoy and possess if thou doest not envy thyself thine own happiness and       that will be if thou shalt forget all that is past and for the future     
  refer thyself wholly to the divine providence and shalt bend and apply       all thy present thoughts and intentions to holiness and righteousness to       holiness in accepting willingly whatsoever is sent by the divine       providence as being that which the nature of the universe hath appointed       unto thee which also hath appointed thee for that whatsoever it be to       righteousness in speaking the truth freely and without ambiguity and in       doing all things justly and discreetly now in this good course let not       other mens either wickedness or opinion or voice hinder thee no nor       the sense of this thy pampered mass of flesh for let that which suffers       look to itself if therefore whensoever the time of thy departing shall       come thou shalt readily leave all things and shalt respect thy mind       only and that divine part of thine and this shall be thine only fear       not that some time or other thou shalt cease to live but thou shalt never       begin to live according to 
nature then shalt thou be a man indeed worthy       of that world from which thou hadst thy beginning then shalt thou cease       to be a stranger in thy country and to wonder at those things that happen       daily as things strange and unexpected and anxiously to depend of divers       things that are not in thy power              ii god beholds our minds and understandings bare and naked from these       material vessels and outsides and all earthly dross for with his simple       and pure understanding he pierceth into our inmost and purest parts       which from his as it were by a water pipe and channel first flowed and       issued this if thou also shalt use to do thou shalt rid thyself of that       manifold luggage wherewith thou art round about encumbered for he that       does regard neither his body nor his clothing nor his dwelling nor any       such external furniture must needs gain unto himself great rest and ease       three things there be in all which thou doest consist of thy body thy    
   life and thy mind of these the two former are so far forth thine as       that thou art bound to take care for them but the third alone is that       which is properly thine if then thou shalt separate from thyself that is       from thy mind whatsoever other men either do or say or whatsoever thou       thyself hast heretofore either done or said and all troublesome thoughts       concerning the future and whatsoever as either belonging to thy body or       life is without the jurisdiction of thine own will and whatsoever in       the ordinary course of human chances and accidents doth happen unto thee       so that thy mind keeping herself loose and free from all outward       coincidental entanglements always in a readiness to depart shall live       by herself and to herself doing that which is just accepting whatsoever       doth happen and speaking the truth always if i say thou shalt separate       from thy mind whatsoever by sympathy might adhere unto it and all time       both past and future and 
shalt make thyself in all points and respects       like unto empedocles his allegorical sphere all round and circular       c and shalt think of no longer life than that which is now present       then shalt thou be truly able to pass the remainder of thy days without       troubles and distractions nobly and generously disposed and in good       favour and correspondency with that spirit which is within thee              iii i have often wondered how it should come to pass that every man       loving himself best should more regard other mens opinions concerning       himself than his own for if any god or grave master standing by should       command any of us to think nothing by himself but what he should presently       speak out no man were able to endure it though but for one day thus do       we fear more what our neighbours will think of us than what we ourselves              iv how come it to pass that the gods having ordered all other things       so well and so lovingly should be overseen in this 
one only thing that       whereas then hath been some very good men that have made many covenants as       it were with god and by many holy actions and outward services contracted       a kind of familiarity with him that these men when once they are dead       should never be restored to life but be extinct for ever but this thou       mayest be sure of that this if it be so indeed would never have been so       ordered by the gods had it been fit otherwise for certainly it was       possible had it been more just so and had it been according to nature       the nature of the universe would easily have borne it but now because it       is not so if so be that it be not so indeed be therefore confident that       it was not fit it should be so for thou seest thyself that now seeking       after this matter how freely thou doest argue and contest with god but       were not the gods both just and good in the highest degree thou durst not       thus reason with them now if just and good it could not be that in
 the       creation of the world they should either unjustly or unreasonably oversee       anything              v use thyself even unto those things that thou doest at first despair       of for the left hand we see which for the most part lieth idle because       not used yet doth it hold the bridle with more strength than the right       because it hath been used unto it              vi let these be the objects of thy ordinary meditation to consider       what manner of men both for soul and body we ought to be whensoever death       shall surprise us the shortness of this our mortal life the immense       vastness of the time that hath been before and will he after us the       frailty of every worldly material object all these things to consider       and behold clearly in themselves all disguisement of external outside       being removed and taken away again to consider the efficient causes of       all things the proper ends and references of all actions what pain is in       itself what pleasure what
 death what fame or honour how every man is       the true and proper ground of his own rest and tranquillity and that no       man can truly be hindered by any other that all is but conceit and       opinion as for the use of thy dogmata thou must carry thyself in the       practice of them rather like unto a pancratiastes or one that at the       same time both fights and wrestles with hands and feet than a gladiator       for this if he lose his sword that he fights with he is gone whereas       the other hath still his hand free which he may easily turn and manage at       his will              vii all worldly things thou must behold and consider dividing them       into matter form and reference or their proper end              viii how happy is man in this his power that hath been granted unto       him that he needs not do anything but what god shall approve and that he       may embrace contentedly whatsoever god doth send unto him              ix whatsoever doth happen in the ordinary course and cons

  whole body of all our actions which is our life if in time it cease be       said to suffer any evil for this very reason because it is at an end nor       he truly be said to have been ill affected that did put a period to this       series of actions now this time or certain period depends of the       determination of nature sometimes of particular nature as when a man       dieth old but of nature in general however the parts whereof thus       changing one after another the whole world still continues fresh and new       now that is ever best and most seasonable which is for the good of the       whole thus it appears that death of itself can neither be hurtful to any       in particular because it is not a shameful thing for neither is it a       thing that depends of our own will nor of itself contrary to the common       good and generally as it is both expedient and seasonable to the whole       that in that respect it must needs be good it is that also which is       brought unto us by the order a

things will appear unto       thee when from on high as it were looking down thou shalt contemplate       all things upon earth and the wonderful mutability that they are subject       unto considering withal the infinite both greatness and variety of       things aerial and things celestial that are round about it and that as       often as thou shalt behold them thou shalt still see the same as the       same things so the same shortness of continuance of all those things       and behold these be the things that we are so proud and puffed up for              xix cast away from thee opinion and thou art safe and what is it that       hinders thee from casting of it away when thou art grieved at anything       hast thou forgotten that all things happen according to the nature of the       universe and that him only it concerns who is in fault and moreover       that what is now done is that which from ever hath been done in the       world and will ever be done and is now done everywhere how nearly all      
 men are allied one to another by a kindred not of blood nor of seed but       of the same mind thou hast also forgotten that every mans mind partakes       of the deity and issueth from thence and that no man can properly call       anything his own no not his son nor his body nor his life for that       they all proceed from that one who is the giver of all things that all       things are but opinion that no man lives properly but that very instant       of time which is now present and therefore that no man whensoever he       dieth can properly be said to lose any more than an instant of time              xx let thy thoughts ever run upon them who once for some one thing or       other were moved with extraordinary indignation who were once in the       highest pitch of either honour or calamity or mutual hatred and enmity       or of any other fortune or condition whatsoever then consider whats now       become of all those things all is turned to smoke all to ashes and a       mere fable and perchance
